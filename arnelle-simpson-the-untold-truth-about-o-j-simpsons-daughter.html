Simpson's Daughter</h1><div><strong>Publish date: </strong>2024-08-22</div><p>Arnelle Simpson is famous as the oldest child and daughter of O.J. Simpson. Her father, O.J. Simpson, is an American former football running back, actor, and broadcaster. He played in the National Football League (NFL) primarily with the Buffalo Bills and is arguably one of the greatest running backs ever.&nbsp;</p><p>Once a popular figure with the American public, O.J. ‘s professional success became overshadowed by his trial and controversial acquittal for the murders of his former wife, Nicole Brown, and her friend, Ron Goldman.</p><p>Consequently, O.J. Simpson’s daughter, Arnelle, became famous following her involvement in her father’s murder trial. In addition, she was at the receiving end of persistent scrutiny by the media.</p><p>However, the former footballer’s eldest child opted to live a quiet life. Due to her father’s notorious run-ins with the law, Arnelle Simpson has been a constant source of interest to the public. Here’s a glimpse into her life.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/photo_2023-09-01_03-50-29-fotor-2023090135216.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Arnelle_Simpson></span>Who Is Arnelle Simpson?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>While testifying during her father’s infamous murder trial, Arnelle told the jury that she was born in December 1968, the same day her father won the Heisman trophy. As earlier stated, she is the first child of the former football player and his first wife, Marguerite L. Whitley. Despite being a subject of interest to eagle-eyed fans, Arnelle Simpson keeps most details about her early life private.&nbsp;</p><p>However, speaking about her childhood experience in an interview with Georgia Newsday in 2014, she said, “Back then, we were the first black family in that neighborhood in Brentwood.” Consequently, this proves that O.J. Simpson’s daughter, Arnelle, grew up in a lovely neighborhood with her parents and had a good education.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/photo_2023-09-01_03-24-17-fotor-2023090132851.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_Does_Arnelle_Simpson_Do_for_a_Living></span>What Does Arnelle Simpson Do for a Living?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>When news about Arnelle’s stepmother Nicole Brown’s murder became public, the once beautiful life of the Simpsons derailed. Brown’s passing marked the start of a difficult period for the family as O.J., alleged to be the killer, became the center of public backlash. Arnelle, who had lived through the best days of their family, perhaps felt the change more than her siblings.</p><p>As the eldest child, Arnelle Simpson bore the brunt of her family’s troubles. However, she couldn’t secure a stable job due to her father’s arrest. Arnelle struggled to carve out a career and had a few significant employment opportunities, including working for a rapper called Hash. In addition, reports suggest she has produced several fashion shows.</p><p>Due to her inability to establish a solid career path, she became a caretaker for her father’s estates and was in charge of her father’s $25,000-a-month NFL pension. However, the family still struggled financially, leading many to believe Arnelle Simpson was irresponsible.&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, it became public knowledge that Arnelle had an alcohol problem, which contributed to the exuberant spending of her father’s money. In addition, reports also suggest that O.J. knew about his daughter’s alcohol problem, as it had been going on even before he went to prison.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_OJ_Simpsons_Daughter_in_a_Relationship></span>Is O.J. Simpson’s Daughter in a Relationship?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>No, she is not. Aside from sacrificing her career to pursue justice for her father, Arnelle’s love life also took a massive blow. There were speculations that Arnelle Simpson and basketball legend Shaquille O’Neal used to be in ‘The Shack’ together. Her relationship with the basketball player reportedly started in September 1995. However, if true, her relationship with “Big Shaq” stayed under the radar.</p><p>After rumors of her involvement with the NBA legend died down, Arnelle Simpson was again on the lips of many in 1996. This time, it was with Anthony Treach Crisis, who was a fast-rising American Rapper at the time. However, the rumored relationship reportedly ended in 1997. Aside from these unconfirmed cases, Arnelle Simpson’s love life, or lack of it, remains a mystery.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/photo_2023-09-01_03-50-35-fotor-2023090135259-824x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_Many_Siblings_Does_OJ_Simpsons_Daughter_Have></span>How Many Siblings Does O.J. Simpson’s Daughter Have?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Arnelle Simpson has four siblings, two full siblings and two half, and is the eldest of five children. O.J. and Whitley married in 1967, and after welcoming Arnelle Simpson, they had Jason Lamar Simpson in 1970. Like Arnelle, Jason also shies away from the media. However, reports suggest he is a chef.</p><p>Afterward, the then-couple welcomed their third addition to the family, Aaren Lashone Simpson, in 1977. Unfortunately, the family mourned after their youngest son, Aaren, drowned in the family’s swimming pool in 1979. In addition, O.J. Simpson’s daughter, Arnelle, also has two half-siblings, Sidney Brooke and Justin Ryan Simpson, from her father’s second marriage to <a href=#>Nicole Brown</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Where_Is_Arnelle_Simpson_Now></span>Where Is Arnelle Simpson Now?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Apart from her appearances in court, Arnelle Simpson has stayed away from the limelight. According to reports, she lives in Fresno, California. In addition, O.J. Simpson’s daughter has an active <a href=#>Instagram</a> account, where she posts pictures of herself hanging out with several kids. However, it is unknown if she has any kids.</p><p>Arnelle’s Instagram also shows that she maintains a close relationship with her mother, Whitley, despite all the mishaps that fell on the Simpson family all those years. According to her Instagram, the mother-daughter duo sometimes go on movie dates, as seen in one of her Instagram posts, which she captioned, “Mom & I at the movies Woman King, Amazing.”</p><p>Like Arnelle Simpson, Eddie Murphy’s son, <a href=#>Miles Mitchell Murphy</a>, has also gained media attention thanks to his famous father.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51krrO6xKWjnmWjnrqxv86nZK2glWLCr8DOpZtmrKKqwal5wJumrqxdpHqredKipKmrn6PAbrDArp6hrJWnfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
