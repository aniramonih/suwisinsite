Will Arnett has a net worth of $35 million. Will Arnett is perhaps best known for his role as Gob Bluth on the hit TV show "Arrested Development," which aired from 2003 to 2019. Arnett has also appeared in a number of popular films, including "Blades of Glory," "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles," and "The Lego Movie." In the Lego universe, Will voices Batman. Arnett's films have grossed a total of over $3.5 billion worldwide. In addition to his acting work, Arnett has also been involved in several high-profile endorsement deals, including campaigns for GMC and Netflix.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Will Arnett was born in 1970 in Toronto, Canada on May 4, 1970 to Edith and Emerson James Arnett. After graduating high school, Will attended Lakefield College School in Lakefield, Ontario, but he was asked to leave after one semester for being a troublemaker. He dropped out of Concordia University in Montreal and moved to New York in 1990 to attend the Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute. As a teenager, Arnett was encouraged by his mother to pursue an acting career. He auditioned for commercials around acting and developed a love for acting.</p><h2 id=early-career><strong>Early Career</strong></h2><p>He landed his first onscreen role in an independent movie by <a href=# title="Felicity Huffman Net Worth">Felicity Huffman</a> called "Erie". He began acting in several shows that weren't picked up by networks or were canceled after several episodes. His first television pilot was shot in 1996 with <a href=# title="Kevin Pollak Net Worth">Kevin Pollak</a> and Lucy Webb for CBS that was not picked up. A few years later, he was in another pilot for "The Mike O'Malley Show" on NBC, but it was canceled after just two episodes. In 2000, Arnett experienced the darkest year of his life, saying that as a response to not getting any work he "drank those years away." In the summer of 2000, a friend helped pull Will out of his battle with alcoholism. Two years later, he finally landed a role in a series that would stick ("Still Standing"), but his character was written off the show after the first episode. After his fourth failed pilot, Arnett decided he was going to swear off all pilots forever…until he was persuaded to audition for the pilot episode of "Arrested Development."</p><h2 id=success><strong>Success</strong></h2><p>Arnett won the part of George Oscar "Gob" Bluth II in the Fox comedy series Arrested Development in 2003. In 2006, he was nominated for his first Emmy for his role as Gob. Due to low ratings, the show was canceled after just three seasons despite its overwhelming critical acclaim and massive cult following. In a nod to his character Gob Bluth's penchant for using Europe's "The Final Countdown" during his magic shows, he played Max the Magician on "Sesame Street." His exposure on Arrested Development led to several larger roles in feature films. In 2006, he starred in his first leading role in "Let's Go to Prison," directed by <a href=# title="Bob Odenkirk Net Worth">Bob Odenkirk</a>. On a budget of $4 million USD, the film earned more than that at the box office and more than $13 million in rentals.

The film was No. 1 at the box office during its first two weeks and made $118 million during its theatrical run.</p><p>Arnett also guest-starred on television shows "King of the Hill" and "30 Rock," for which he was nominated for four Emmy Awards for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series. He earned supporting roles in the films "Spring Breakdown," "Hot Rod," "The Comebacks," and "On Broadway." In "The Brothers Solomon," Arnett again teamed up with Odenkirk. In his second film with <a href=# title="Will Ferrell Net Worth">Will Ferrell</a>, he played Lou Redwood in the basketball comedy "Semi Pro."

In 2017, he was cast in the recurring role of Mr. Quagmire on the Netflix comedy-drama series "A Series of Unfortunate Events."</p><p>His distinctive deep and gravelly voice has earned him several spots for CBS promos, trailers, and ads.

From 2014 to 2020 he voiced several characters on "BoJack Horseman".
