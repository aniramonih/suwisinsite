It’s really hard and depends on how the scheduling is for that week, but I do try to stay active. I like to walk and be outdoors.”</p><p>With reporting by Ingrid Meilan</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGajrZSueqi%2BxJ6prGWWnsGvsdKsZKunpam2r7GMnaCerF2ptrG%2FjKWcpJ6ZqXq4u9Gkpq6sXaiura3DrGY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
