In 1994, Kevin earned a Master of Business Administration from the school, and as a college student, he worked for the Kern County Fire Department as a seasonal firefighter and landed an internship with Congressman Bill Thomas.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-342626 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/kevin-mccarthy-1.jpg alt width=678 height=546 sizes="(max-width: 678px) 100vw, 678px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-342626 class=wp-caption-text>Kevin McCarthy (Public Domain)</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>From 1987 to 2002, McCarthy was a staff member at Congressman Bill Thomas' office, and he was Thomas' district director from the late '90s until 2000.

In 2006, Bill Thomas retired from the House of Representatives and Kevin won his seat with 70.7% of the vote. After the insurrection in 2021, Thomas went on television to express disappointment in his former protégé repeating Trump's "phony lies" about the 2020 election, and in a 2022 interview with "The New Yorker,"&nbsp; Bill stated, "The Kevin McCarthy who is now, at this time, in the House isn't the Kevin McCarthy I worked with. At least from outward appearances. You never know what's inside, really. Kevin basically is whatever you want him to be. He lies. He'll change the lie if necessary. How can anyone trust his word?"</p><p>After being elected to the House of Representatives, McCarthy ran unopposed in 2008 and 2010.

Shortly after Kevin dropped out of the Speaker of the House race in 2015, he was accused of having an affair with married Republican congresswoman Renee Ellmers. A few days before McCarthy dropped out, Representative Walter B. Jones Jr. sent a letter to Republican Conference chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers in which he urged his fellow Republican members of Congress to step aside if they had committed any "misdeeds." McCarthy and Ellmers both denied allegations of an affair.</p><h2 id=real-estate><strong>Real Estate</strong></h2><p>McCarthy and his wife own a 1,571 square foot home in Bakersfield, California, that was built in 1987.
