Unfortunately, that came true in February 2001.</p><p><strong>READ MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Parker Schnabel and Tyler Mahoney’s relationship</a></p><h2><strong>What were Dale Earnhardt’s last words?</strong></h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-68139 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Dale-Earnhardts-last-words-the-prophecy.jpg.webp alt="Dale Earnhardt’s last words the prophecy" width=800 height=1200 sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 24px), 720px" data-pin-media=https://famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Dale-Earnhardts-last-words-the-prophecy.jpg id=mv-trellis-img-3 data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-68139 class=wp-caption-text>@Getty</p><p>So, the legend goes that on the run-up to the race beginning, he told Darrell Waltrip one thing: “I’m the happiest I’ve ever been in my life.”</p><p>That sounds depressing when you factor in that the man died not long after he said those words.</p><p>Part of his happiness and contentment, though, was doing what he loved so much.</p><p>The Daytona 500 is one of the biggest races in the world, and the fact that this was Fox Sports’ first time getting a chance to broadcast it made this a major moment.</p><p>Earnhardt came into the race as one of the favorites, having already won the race in the past and having come 35th overall.</p><p>Earnhardt’s final interview came with Fox’s presenter, Matt Yocum, and on that, he talked about the conditions of the fateful race: “A little wind today. A little exciting. I think it’s going to be some exciting racing. You’re gonna see something you probably had never seen on Fox.”</p><p>Regretfully, that was to come true in a way that nobody could ever have possibly imagined. However, despite his daredevil streak, it was reported that Earnhardt had told Richard Childress that “if they don’t do something to these cars, it’s going to end up killing somebody” – that somebody, depressingly, was Earnhardt himself.</p><p><strong>READ MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Was Matthew Gray Gubler in Tangled</a>?</p><h2><strong>In Conclusion</strong></h2><p>So, the final words of Earnhardt are quite prophetic – he mentioned how happy he was, but also the risks that came with what he did for a living.</p><p>Few people are ever quite as lucid and aware of the risks they take as professional rally drivers. But, despite dying doing what made him so happy in life, it is sad that such a fulfilling and happy life was cut short at its peak.</p><p>Even today, Dale Earnhardt is one of the most respected and beloved drivers of all time.</p><p>His drive, his skill, his willingness to take risks, and his pure love of the sport made him such an easy personality to love.</p><p>As his final words showed, he was happy – even when it cost him everything.</p><p>RIP Dale.</p><h2 style=text-align:center><strong>READ THIS NEXT:</strong></h2><p style=text-align:center><a href=#>Did Teresa Earnhardt remarried</a>?</p><p style=text-align:center><a href=#>Jeffrey Earnhardt Net Worth</a></p><p style=text-align:center><a href=#>Kelley Earnhardt Miller Net Worth</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaK8tr%2FPnqappJWpvKWt2GeaqKVfma6tsYyemKummJa%2FpcDSZqOaq6RixLC%2Bw6xm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
