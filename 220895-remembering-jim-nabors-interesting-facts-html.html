He had two older sisters, Freddie and Annie Ruth, who all grew up in Alabama with him as well.</p><p class=dh>From a young age, Nabors began expressing himself through performing. He sang in high school and was a part of his church choir. After graduating college from the University of Alabama, he got a start on his stage career.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/b6b14270f9ec7b16273968d41d683c35.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>American comedian and singer Jim Nabors leans his chin on his hand and relaxes over a cup of coffee while at a rehearsal for an upcoming show, September 6, 1965. | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>LIFE BEFORE HIS CAREER TOOK OFF</strong></p><p class=dh>Nabors would do skits early on, but his first job ended up being a typist role for the United Nations in New York. A year later, Nabors moved to Chattanooga, Tennessee, and landed a job as a film cutter for NBC.</p><p class=dh>Due to his asthma, Nabors could not remain in Tennesee, so he decided to move to Los Angeles. He continued to pursue his love of entertainment and landed another job as NBC's assistant film editor.</p><p class=dh>During his off-hours, Nabors sang and acted at various clubs. One of them was the famous Santa Monica nightclub, where Nabors showed off his ability to go from a high-pitched comedian to a baritone singer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/648d307c38d804c453e691e6a7ce3f9c357601571421315.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Jim Nabors at The Hollywood Palladium, March 7, 2004 in Hollywood, California. | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>LANDING HIS MOST FAMOUS ROLE</strong></p><p class=dh>Bill Dana reportedly <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=http://www.closerweekly.com/posts/heres-what-happened-to-gomer-pyle-from-the-andy-griffith-show/>discovered</a> him during one of his cabaret acts based loosely on an Andy Griffith scene. Nabors would later audition for Steve Allen and go on to appear on the latter's variety show numerous times.</p><p class=dh>Soon enough, Andy Griffith took notice of Nabors' musical gimmick and created the part of Gomer Pyle on "The Andy Griffith Show." Pyle became a fan favorite with his signature phrases, "gawwleee" and "shazzayam."</p><p class=dh>Nabors came on in the third season. After 26 episodes, Nabors left and got his show, "Gomer Pyle: USMC," in 1964. The show was a success, running for five seasons and turning Nabors into a household name.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/2ebea47f3e439ddce21b5fb2b2e4198a372951571423394.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Jim Nabors and Andy Griffith at the Hammerstein Ballroom November 02, 2003 in New York City. | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>GETTING HIS OWN VARIETY SHOW</strong></p><p class=dh>When "Gomer Pyle: USMC" ended, Nabors was financially stable enough to have the freedom to do what he wanted, like pursuing a singing career and doing Vegas shows. In terms of other work in television, he was somewhat typecasted because of his previous TV roles.</p><p class=dh>Luckily, he landed his own variety show in 1969. "The Jim Nabors Hour" saw Nabors singing with guests, doing comedy sketches, and, surprisingly, making even more money than his previous series.</p><p class=dh>Unfortunately, the show abruptly ended in 1971 despite high ratings. Nabors did not slow down, though, and immediately began planning an entertainment summer tour.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/e4a3ccf1a9d3ca8c5d74c8c13882686a738521571420146.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Jim Nabors at Indianapolis Motorspeedway on May 25, 2014 in Indianapolis, Indiana. | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>GUEST APPEARANCES AND MOVIE ROLES</strong></p><p class=dh>He also appeared on various shows, including "The Joey Bishop Show," "The Tonight Show," "The Dean Martin Show," "The David Frost Show," "The Lost Saucer," and "The Rookies."</p><p class=dh>At various times between 1972 and 2014, Nabors performed with the Purdue All-American Marching Band singing "Back Home Again in Indiana" before the races. It was one of his fonder gigs after his career slowed.</p><p class=dh>Nabors' Hollywood connections landed him roles in 1982's "The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas" and 1983's "Stroker Ace." Additionally, he acted in theater alongside Florence Henderson in "The Music Man," thanks to Burt Reynolds.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/156005c5baf40ff51a327f1c34f2975b4424821577382869.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Jim Nabors at the opening of the Indianapolis 500 on May 24, 2008. | Photo: Wikimedia Commons, BSquared AKA Family Paparazzi, CC BY 2.0</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>OPENING UP ABOUT HIS SEXUALITY</strong></p><p class=dh>Throughout most of his life, Nabors <a class="me a" href=#>hid the fact</a> that he was gay. He had his awakening as a child, but he decided not to make a big deal out of it by keeping it private. Speaking about his sexuality, he once <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/story/20805642/exclusive-actor-jim-nabors-marries-his-longtime-male-partner/>said:</a></p><p class=dh>"I haven't ever made a public spectacle of it.

They first met in 1975 when Cadwallader worked as a firefighter. After a while, he worked for Nabors, and the pair began a relationship.</p><p class=dh>Ultimately, he kept his sexuality a secret not because he was ashamed but because he wanted to keep things private.
