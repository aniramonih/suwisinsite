While each agent has their own favorites, Good American, Tularosa and Karen Sabago seem to be among the top contenders.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>And with season 4 around the corner, it’s safe to say that girls are <a href=#>stepping up their style game</a>. After all, according to <a href=#><strong>Christine Quinn</strong></a>, the cast is finally “following” in her footsteps and giving their glam a refresh.</p><p class=p1>“I recognize that everyone definitely upped the hair, upped the glam, upped the outfits,” she told Us earlier this year. “The girls were like, ‘This show is about real estate.’ And I’m like, ‘You’re stupid, this show ain’t about real estate. Come on. Step it up.’”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>The 32-year-old fashionista, who recently dropped a beauty collab with Ciaté London, practices what she preaches too.

But it was her accessory game that brought her look to the next level. She rocked bling from Jennifer Fisher and Zarianas.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><a href=#><strong>Chrishell Stause</strong></a> is another star the heats up the ‘gram on repeat.

I try not to eat meat, but I’m not saying that I’m vegetarian or vegan. I love animals, so I try and eat with a conscience.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>So, to see Stause’s fit figure and the rest of the cast’s stellar swim style, keep scrolling!
