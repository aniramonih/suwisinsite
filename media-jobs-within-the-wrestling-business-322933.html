Buy some webspace, set up a website and start writing. There are a few members of the forum who already do this.<p>If you want to work IN the industry and not just write about it from the outside, then you'll likely have to find a good suitcase and start going wherever the wrestlers are. Buy them drinks, be trustworthy and get interviews. Obviously, any wrestler worth writing about isn't going to just do an interview with any drunkard off the street, so you need to have evidence you are a legitimate resource...which brings you back to the website.</p><p>Otherwise, you need to have some serious credentials in some area which an employer will find intriguing. Be a great writer, know how to edit video or use Photoshop, etc. Volunteering with some local promotions wouldn't hurt your odds either and, if the wrestling scene is similar there as it is here, I'm sure there are no shortage of promotions who wouldn't mind some extra hands for little or no cost.</p><p>Being successful in any business endeavor is always going to be hard work. But in a business like pro wrestling, where there is such a wide range of business practices, you'll likely have to "pay your dues" to get anywhere.</p><p>My advice would be this. Grab a domain name and some cheap web hosting. Set up a website (I like using Joomla as my website framework due to its incredible flexibility, but others like Wordpress because it doesn't require much technical know-how). Join Google's ad network program. Start writing. Consider making HIGH QUALITY YouTube videos about wrestling. Start there and see if your interest grows or wanes and if you can build an audience. This is probably the slowest path to relevance, but it is also the least risky and you can do it in your free time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmien6fCrr%2BNsKmeq6Shsru7zZ5lnKedZMGpvsSam6xnnZqxqq2Mo6abq12strW0yKdkraCVYsSzsdKto6Kml2Kvtr%2FIp5ysq15of3OFkmxm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
