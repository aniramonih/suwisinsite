I just do what makes sense. If I'm craving a hamburger, I'll have a hamburger. But then the next day I'll make sure that I have a salad, a lot of water, and a good mix of vegetables. Same goes for something like pizza, if I want it I'll have it, but then the next day I'll make sure it is filled with healthy habits," Porsha told </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Glamour</span></a><span>. She eats vegan-ish, which helped her drop 10 pounds. "My big news in my house is that I am a born-again vegan. Baby vegan, to be exact," she </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>shared</span></a><span> in 2020. "Baby vegan is basically a vegan that is completely plant-based, so I'm about 99.9 percent vegan. Meaning if the Lord say, 'Today you can have that cheese on that salad,' then I am not going to pick it off because that would be against what the Lord wants for me."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/07/intermittent-fasting.jpg><p><span>"I also do intermittent fasting at times, which is where you only eat between a certain set of hours then fast the rest of the day," Porsha told Glamour. "When I do it, I'll typically limit my eating window to about six hours."&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Porsha has trained with Darrell Patterson for six years. Sometimes they box together and others, strength or weight training. "I never skip abs. For some crazy reason I actually enjoy them. I can do a countless number, it's like I have that natural strength. But since I had a baby, that's been my main focus area," she told Glamour.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>"I had no choice but to put my treadmill in my bedroom," Porsha revealed to Glamour about how she prioritizes cardio. "So now I see it when I wake up, and I get right into doing about forty minutes on an incline at a 4.0 pace." She gets on the machine "at least four days a week and I get with a trainer once a week."</span></p><p><span>Porsha maintains that self-care helps her cope, she wrote in an essay for Women's Health. "To prevent or deal with the stress of any negative thoughts, I try to practice lots of self-care. In fact, I make sure to pencil it in to my schedule. So whether it's space and time for me to do some yoga, meditate, steam my face, or just sit in my bathtub, I make sure I have the pockets of peace I need to help me maintain my mental health," she wrote.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>In her latest workout video Portia starts on the elliptical machine, a form of cardio. Then she moves onto strength training, doing a variety of exercises including kettlebell swings, kettlebell squats, medicine ball slams, and then ends by stretching.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifLG70ayfmmWnnrmttcCmqmahnmLBuLuMqaCem5VixLC%2ByqisrWWXmq6zedKhmKudo2K6unnIp6qpoaKWwaq7zWg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
