She is a model and actress, however, she is perhaps unfortunately best known for her relationship and subsequent divorce proceedings with the former NFL player <a href=#>Deion Sanders</a>, which is a main source of Pilar Sanders’ net worth. She debuted in the entertainment industry as a model in 1990.</p><p>How rich is this model and actress? Estimations by authoritative sources show that Pilar Sanders net worth currently stands at $10 million, however, it looks like Pilar wanted to make quite a fortune and sued her former husband to pay $14,000 per month for child support and mortgage. She even managed to present a $24,000 bill in which such items as $2,000 for children’s lessons, $2,000 for food and restaurants, $1,000 for entertainment, $900 clothing, $750 child care, $500 school lunches, $500 cell phones and $450 personal care and haircuts were included, quite an extensive list of expenditures. As the custody of the children is divided between the parents, the requested amounts were not awarded. More, the court ordered her to pay $275,000 to Pilar’s attorneys in legal fees.</p><h3>Pilar Sanders Net Worth $10 Million</h3><p>To begin with, Pilar grew up in New York. While still being a student at high school she pursued a career in modelling, securing contracts with two prestigious modelling companies, Irene Marie and Ford Models. At that time modelling was not only a very important part of her life, it was also a very significant source of Pilar Sanders’ net worth.</p><p>In addition to being a model, Pilar became involved in acting. She created roles in episodes of several series including the sitcom “The <a href=#>Jamie Foxx</a> Show” (1996) created by Bentley Kyle Evans and <a href=#>Jamie Foxx</a>, the police procedural series “Walker, Texas Ranger” (1997) created by Albert S.

Those roles also increased the net worth of Pilar.</p><p>More, the reality television series which focused on the home life of Pilar and her husband entitled “<a href=#>Deion</a> and Pilar: Prime Time Love” (2008) was on Oxygen television channel for one season. The series was co-produced by her husband <a href=#>Deion Sanders</a>, though due to low ratings it was closed. More, Pilar has launched the children summer camp Prime Time Achievers which has also added sums to the overall size of her net worth. Additionally, it should be mentioned that she founded Essence of Beshalom, a foundation to support girls, to be precise to make them feel more confident.</p><p>Some facts about the private life of Pilar Sanders: she married the professional football player <a href=#>Deion Sanders</a> in 1999, and they have three children. Because of the constant abuse in the family Pilar Sanders filed for divorce. The two separated in 2012, and the divorce settlement was ended in 2013.
