No secret is safe.”</p><p>The <a href=#>New Hampshire native</a> noted that the show’s first season aired three weeks before she and Jenner broke up. The separation, however, has not ruined their bond.</p><p>“I think the reason he and I ended up getting married in the first place was because we were always such good friends,” she explained. “And that is something we’ve been able to salvage through our split.”</p><p>Carter has since moved on and has been dating the Brock Collection founder since May.</p><p>“I don’t want to have a relationship that’s in the tabloids. I don’t want to do overly public things,” she said, before opening up about her new flame.</p><p>According to Carter, her dynamic with the Texas native is “going very well” and has no drama.</p><p>“It’s the most seamless, chill relationship,” she said. “I’ve never had a relationship that was just easy. I feel like he’s the first adult that I’ve ever dated.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The <a href=#>TV personality</a> called her boyfriend the “gayest straight man” she knows, noting the pair have a “lot of feminine things in common.”</p><p>She added: “He’s a dream.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGakmZmpubq6zWaamqqkmr9uvsSfo56bpKh6sLqMpqClnalisLq%2B1Kxkm6qfmcZutsSnpZ6qXae8rq3NnJysZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
