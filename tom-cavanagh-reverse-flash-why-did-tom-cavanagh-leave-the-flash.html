So basically, Tom Cavanagh is a Canada-based actor who was born on October 26, 1963. As of now, he is 59 years old. Apart from “The Flash” he also worked in some amazing movies like&nbsp; Ed, Love Monkey, and Trust Me and recurring roles on Providence and Scrubs.</p><p>Although he worked in these amazing movies but people mostly know him by his role in “The Flash”. He has portrayed renowned scientist Harrison Wells or a version of him at least. Well, as we all know that Tom Cavansh has left this series and probably we never see him in this series again but the question is that why did he leave it?</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=s20c428d7e4f8fbb607cb621fbb09d2c9 data-wpel-link=internal><span class=ctaText>See also</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>Tom Cavanagh's Net Worth in 2023: How much fortune does "Hey Yahoo" host own?</span></a><h2 id=why-did-tom-cavanagh-leave-the-flash class="rb-heading-index-1 wp-block-heading">Why did Tom Cavanagh Leave The Flash?</h2><p>Well according to some sources, he left the series“Flash” because he just felt like he was getting close to an exit, having told himself that he would only continue so long as he felt challenged and like he was contributing to the series’ overall storyline. Apart from that, in an interview, he also said “No, that was my decision. It was definitely my decision. You also have to keep in mind that the show you’re doing is not called Wells. It’s called The Flash.&nbsp;</p><p>At a certain point, I thought in the back of my head, “I’m going to do this for as long as I really feel challenged and it’s enjoyable and that I’m contributing to Flash’s storyline.” I thought after Sherloque was tracking down himself, the Reverse Flash, even early on in that season, ‘Yeah, this feels like I might be heading towards the exit now.’ I thought that would be a perfect denouement. The Wells characters have been fun, but like we say, the show is called The Flash and it’ll be fine without me.”</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=s20c428d7e4f8fbb607cb621fbb09d2c9 data-wpel-link=internal><span class=ctaText>See also</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>Hey Yahoo Host: Why did Tom Cavanagh Selected to Host The Game Show?</span></a><h2 id=eobard-thawne-aka-reverseflash-in-8220the-flash8221-for-grand-finale class="rb-heading-index-2 wp-block-heading">Eobard Thawne aka Reverse-Flash in “The Flash” for Grand Finale:</h2><p>Well apart from all these things, there is a good news for “The Flash” fans because Tom is coming back for the grand finale. Yes, you heard it right <strong>Tom Cavanagh returns to play a resurrected Thawne, pulled from some point before his most recent apparent death in The Flash season 8 finale</strong>. Although there are many supervillains who are obsessed and pretty with revenge but Eobard Thawne is on another level, but there is no need to make you understand how Eobard Thawne pushed his hatred of The Flash to unthinkable extremes.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHb7rAspigZpOkunDAzqZknJmmlruis8dmqZ6ulafApnnFpZisoF2stbp5w6KbZqyfonqkrdWapZqfmGK5pq3VnmStoJVis62t0qFm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
