One of them is&nbsp;<strong>Angela Victoria Johnson,&nbsp;</strong>who came into the spotlight as the mother of&nbsp;<strong>Chloe Chrisley's </strong>mother. She gave birth to Chloe in 2012 with her ex-boyfriend, <a href=#><strong>Kyle Chrisley</strong></a>, the son of&nbsp;<strong>Todd Chrisley&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>Teresa Terry</strong>.</p><p>She was born on 26 September 1968 in Iva in South California. As per her citizenship, she is American and belongs to the white ethnicity. Further, she has not disclosed any information regarding her family and educational background to the media.</p><h2>Mother of One Daughter, Chloe Chrisley</h2><p><a href=#><strong>Chloe Chrisley </strong></a>was born to parents Angela and Kyle Chrisley on 10 November 2012. Kyle is a reality TV star who is known for his work in the American reality series <i>Chrisley Knows Best</i>.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/6/20/4-3-1592646721044.jpg><p>Apart from <i>Chrisley Knows Best</i>, she has also appeared in <i>Growing Up Chrisley</i>, and <i>Chrisley Knows Thanksgiving</i>.&nbsp;</p><h2>Angela&nbsp;Previous Relationship</h2><p>In the previous time, Angela and Kyle shared a lowkey or completely intimate relationship together. But they have still not disclosed how they first met. Kyle was completely drowned in drug addiction during their relationship, so he was sent to therapy and treated there for several years.</p><p>After giving birth to her baby girl, she moved temporarily with Chrisley's family in Atlanta. Likewise, when her daughter Chloe was about a year old, she made her TV debut in March 2013. Angela and Kyle, however, called it quits.</p><h2>A Legal Allegation</h2><p>After the division, Chrisley's family filed a lawsuit against her on 7 October 2013. She even battled for her daughter's custody then. But sadly, the family of Chrisley settled the lawsuit and kept her daughter with them.</p><p>Since then, Kyle's dad has been taking full custody of 7 years old Chloe. And Chloe becomes a regular on the show Chrisley Knows Best.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/6/20/Capture-1592646825276.JPG><p>But Kyle once said that his dad was not interested in his daughter before the series because she is a mixed-race kid. He used his daughter on their performance to raise ratings.</p><p>Similarly, Kyle once charged the abduction of kidnapping his daughter, Chloe. But Todd said he was shielding her from the daily sickness that his son Kyle struggles with. Angela even confirmed Chloe is with them due to his violence problems.&nbsp;</p><h2>What is Angela's Current Relationship Status?</h2><p>Still, talking about her personal life, many of the details are under wraps. She has never made public to the media her current relationships and marriage at the present moment. And we can say that Johnson must be living a single life without dating any lovers.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/6/20/2-4-1592646729665.jpg><p>On the other hand, her ex-boyfriend is in a marital relationship with his wife<strong>, Alexus Whilby</strong>. Chisley and Whilby tied the knot in the year 2014. Further, they have four children together from their marriage.</p><h2>How Rich is Angela's Victoria Johnson?</h2><p>Currently, Johnson has been working as a nurse for over four years, according to some sources. So, she must be earning a decent amount of money. Although her exact amount of net worth has not been mentioned anywhere, it is assumed to be over<strong>&nbsp;$300 thousand. </strong><a href=#><strong>Bruce Weyman</strong></a> also holds $300 thousand from his career.</p><p>The average annual salary for a registered nurse is<strong>&nbsp;$73,550,&nbsp;</strong>which breaks down to an average of&nbsp;<strong>$6,129 p</strong>er month. Therefore, compensation of Angela falls within the same range, without any doubt.</p><p>On the other hand, her ex-partner, Kyle, has a worth of<strong>&nbsp;$500,000</strong>. Meanwhile, Kyle's dad, Todd Chrisley, 's total fortune is about&nbsp;<strong>$5 million</strong>&nbsp;as of early June 2022. He has made that fortune during his career as an actor.</p><h2>Angela&nbsp;Is Fighting For Her Daughter's Custody</h2><p>Well, every mother loves their children more than anything in the world, and so does the American nurse <strong>Angela Victoria Johnson</strong>. She is very eager to take custody of her only daughter from her ex-boyfriend's hands.</p><p>In 2016, &nbsp;Angela talked about her daughter's custody with a tearful face in an interview with <a href=# rel=nofollow>TMZ.</a> In that interview, she stated,</p><p>I don’t think it’s right for them to just pretend that I don’t exist</p><p>Moreover, she continued,</p><p>I don’t think it’s right. At the end of the day, I’m her biological mother. I was cut out of her life. I didn’t walk away from her. I was pushed out of her life and they wanted me to forget about Chloe. And they wanted Chloe to forget about me like I don’t exist</p><p>Well, after Chloe, her father, and her stepmom went behind bars, she plans on regaining the custody of her daughter.</p><p><i><strong>Let's Read More Amusing Biographies & Articles At&nbsp;</strong></i><a href=#><i><strong>Married Celeb</strong></i></a><i><strong>!!!</strong></i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDnJylnZJjsLC5jpqloJ2clnq3tcKtpquhkWK3sLTNrKan</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
