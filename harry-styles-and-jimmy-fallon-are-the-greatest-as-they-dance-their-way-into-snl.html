Over the course of the last 6 years, we’ve watched Harry, Louis, Liam, Niall, and Zayn grown into incredible young men. The band, as they exist now, took a hiatus at the end of 2015 and have been exploring solo interests ever since and the latest to show their work to the public was Harry Styles himself.</p><p>After filming Dunkirk and taking the time to write an album without being rushed, he debuted his solo single ‘Sign of the Times’ on April 7th. The tune immediately resonated with fans of One Direction but also with non-fans around the world. He didn’t take the pop route, he didn’t do something that would immediately grab the same target audience One Direction had before their hiatus. Instead, he followed his heart and released something deeply personal and extremely impressive.</p><p></p><p>In addition to releasing the single – he secured a debut on Saturday Night Live, and it’s not just any appearance. He’ll be making his solo right of passage on a night where SNL is premiering live coast to coast – so it’s a pretty big deal. Bringing Fallon and Styles together for this occasion makes sense, they aren’t strangers by any means, and their chemistry together is quite hilarious.</p><p></p><p>We aren’t sure what exactly they were going for, or if they even know themselves, but we’re getting West Side Story meets some wacky comedy vibes from these promo previews and we are loving it.</p><p>Saturday Night Live will go live at 11:30 on the east coast, 8:30 on the west coast, this Saturday the 15th. We’ll be watching and cheering Harry on as he sings ‘Sign of the Times’ live for the first time, be still our hearts, we can’t contain our pride.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7nIsWWcp51ktaK%2B0bJkrKypobK0ecCnm2aimaK6unnFmqOlp55irrOxjK2fnmWXp7KiwMSsq2aZo2LBqbHYZpuappOaerW0xKKpZq%2BRrnqqutOoZKymnGQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
