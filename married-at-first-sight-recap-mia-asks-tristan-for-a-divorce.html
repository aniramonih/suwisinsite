However, things went south on the drive there when Tristan told Mia that Dave heard Mia say that he kicked her out.</p><p>“Mia paints a picture of that she is the victim almost each time,” Tristan said. “It makes me feel pissed off.”</p><p>Once they got to the hotel, the two decided to go to sleep. Apparently Mia woke up in the middle of the night with a panic attack and asked Tristan for a divorce. She packed up her stuff in the middle of the night and left.</p><p>“I just feel complete disappointment,” Tristan said. “I am pretty sure this is the final straw for our marriage.”</p><p><strong>Bobby Gets Defensive Over Danielle</strong></p><p><strong>Bobby Dodd</strong> and <strong>Danielle Bergman</strong> have become so predictable at this point. They never fight and they are very much in love. <strong>Dave Flaherty</strong> wasn’t exactly buying it, and questioned Bobby about whether or not he was sliding some things under the rug.</p><p>“I think that there is probably some stuff that’s bothering you guys that you may not be talking about,” Dave said, which set Bobby off.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/bobby-danielle-married-first-sight.jpg><p>“I’m going to get defensive,” Bobby replied. “You are totally wrong.”</p><p>He insured Dave his marriage was genuine, and Dave seemed to understand it once Bobby spoke his mind.</p><p><strong>Dave Is Still Unsure About Amber</strong></p><p><strong>Amber Martorana</strong> and Dave have been doing better lately in their marriage, but apparently Dave is still “on the fence” about what he will do come decision day.</p><p>“When times get tough, she can make them tougher,” Dave said. “I also really want to be with someone who I can be with forever.”</p><p>Amber seemed to sense Dave’s pensiveness and was stressed about the day herself. “I don’t want to give up, but I don’t want to be with someone that doesn’t want to be with me,” Amber said.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Hopefully the mini-moon will help the couple reconnect and make a clear decision.</p><p>Married at First Sight (produced by Kinetic Content) airs on Lifetime Tuesdays at 9 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKSaqqKesqV5wK1kn6GiqMFuv8ign61lopqworyMpqCaZZGouLR506ugrKyRo3qnu9FmmGacmau8s6%2FEaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
