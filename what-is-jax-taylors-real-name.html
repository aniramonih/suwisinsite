&#34;I changed my name when I was 21,&#34; Taylor revealed to The Daily Dish in 2018. &#34;It was more of a thing where I was traveling and I was modeling.

Yep, this is good.' And then it just stuck. So that's really where the name came from,"&nbsp;he explained.</p><p>Unfortunately, however, the new name eventually started wearing on the then-reality-star.
