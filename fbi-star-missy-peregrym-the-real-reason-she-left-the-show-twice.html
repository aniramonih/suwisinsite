Maggie was rushed to the hospital, and remained there for the rest of season four and the first six episodes of season five.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/52aba4fa9686-fbi-maggiebell-2.jpg><p id=en1AfuAinM data-wc=60>Maggie<a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>&nbsp;returned to the field in season five, episode 7,</a> on November 15, 2022, and the return of Maggie played out across a two-episode arc that followed how she would react to being back in the field following the effects of her injuries, and in particular how her partner OA (Zeeko Zaki) would cope with the return of his friend.&nbsp;</p><p id=enMgym3aSV data-wc=20>Missy also acknowledged that her return after seven months away felt very similar to Maggie's to the New York office.&nbsp;</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<p id=eFZs22EfAv data-wc=42>"Maggie had seven months off, and we’re both coming back for Day 1 a little bit nervous, hoping we can do the job right out of it.
