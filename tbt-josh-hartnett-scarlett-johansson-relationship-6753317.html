Interestingly, what brought them together in the first place, namely, their work, is the same thing that eventually drove them apart, as Hartnett later revealed.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Here's a look back at Josh Hartnett and Scarlett Johansson's relationship.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-2005-josh-hartnett-and-scarlett-johansson-first-meet></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>2005: Josh Hartnett and Scarlett Johansson first meet</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The two young actors met on the set of the crime thriller&nbsp;The Black Dahlia&nbsp;in 2005. In the film, Hartnett played detective Dwight "Bucky" Bleichert, one of the lead investigators in the murder of Hollywood starlet Elizabeth Short, along with his partner Lee Blanchard (Aaron Eckhart). Johansson took on the role of Kay Lake, the girlfriend of Blanchard and later Bleichert.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-2005-josh-hartnett-and-scarlett-johansson-are-first-spotted-together></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>2005: Josh Hartnett and Scarlett Johansson are first spotted together</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The pair tried out their chemistry off-screen and began dating, which apparently made it even more uncomfortable to shoot steamy scenes with each other on set.&nbsp;<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It was very difficult for me," the&nbsp;Penny Dreadful&nbsp;alum said in 2006,&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>per TMZ</a>. "Those scenes are eternally awkward because you got a bunch of sweaty dudes sitting and watching you, and you're just hoping to make it intimate, make it real."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After filming wrapped, Hartnett and Johansson attempted to keep their relationship low-key, frequently hanging out in the Lower East Side at Max Fish and canoodling in the corners of London nightclubs. While they rarely spoke about each other in the press, Johansson dropped a cute tidbit during a 2006 interview with&nbsp;Allure.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Josh is very sweet,"&nbsp;The Avengers&nbsp;actress said,&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>according to CBS News</a>. "He's a good boy. A great person. I'm very lucky, and I'm very happy."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-2007-josh-hartnett-and-scarlett-johansson-praise-each-others-work-ethic></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>2007: Josh Hartnett and Scarlett Johansson praise each other's work ethic</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Take away their fame and ultra-good looks, and ultimately, Hartnett and Johansson were just two theater nerds who understood and respected each other’s craft.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Josh is such a wonderful actor. I've always admired him and felt that he was a very, very talented young actor," Johansson&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>said during a press run</a>&nbsp;for&nbsp;The Black Dahlia. "He's very intense when he works. He's very focused, very passionate about what he's doing, and I really appreciate that."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Hartnett also had nothing but nice things to say when speaking about his then-girlfriend's work ethic, telling the same outlet, "Scarlett is intuitive, open, and present on the film set."<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He added of Johansson, "She's a lot of fun to work with. She makes everything lighter than you would expect. Everybody has a little bit of a spring in their step when Scarlett's on set, but she keeps the work at the forefront of her mind, and she does terrific work."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-2007-josh-hartnett-and-scarlett-johansson-break-up></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>2007: Josh Hartnett and Scarlett Johansson break up</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After dating for nearly two years, ScarJo and Hartnett decided to go their separate ways. According to the&nbsp;40 Days and 40 Nights&nbsp;star, their split was due to the long distance. He spoke about their "really painful" breakup in an exclusive interview with&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The Mirror</a>&nbsp;in 2007, revealing that "it was difficult spending so much time apart" with their different schedules and traveling across the world for work.&nbsp;<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Hartnett added, "At the end of the day, we're just ordinary people, and it didn't work."&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2014, Hartnett opened up about the pair's high-profile relationship again, except this time, he expressed a bit of regret.&nbsp;<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When asked about his habit of dating co-stars like ScarJo, he&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>told&nbsp;Elle</a>, "I don't recommend it to young actors. You can make a lot of enemies in the business that way, but when you work with somebody every day, it's like trial dating. You develop a fantasy about them. It doesn't always work out, does it?"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK5705urZqKfqLVutMCrq6edpKl6tK%2FAq6OerKRit7C0wKeqrKeeYr%2BmuMCtoKimo522sXmVcGxsa2Fs</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
