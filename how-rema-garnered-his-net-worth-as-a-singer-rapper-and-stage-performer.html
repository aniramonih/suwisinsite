The Nigerian artist who was born on 1st May 2000 has been making money since he was 19.</p><p>He first appeared on the Nigerian music scene as a teen rapper after being discovered by a top music record, Mavin Records. He is currently known as one of the highest-earning artists out there, with his net worth growing each year.&nbsp; He’s sold-out events, collaborated with other notable artists such as <a href=# rel=noopener data-wpel-link=internal>Tiwa Savage</a>, and even promotes other people’s songs. But how much is he really worth?</p><h2><b>Breakdown of Rema’s Estimated $1 Million Net Worth</b></h2><p>The young multi-talented artist is so successful that he counts his blessings and smiles to the bank with an estimated net worth of $1 Million US Dollars. His sources of income include writing songs, singing, rapping, endorsements, and stage performances. Who said hard work does not pay?</p><h3><b>Singing</b></h3><p>While the artist has a bunch of different streams of income, music is one of his biggest money-makers. As an artist, he stole the hearts of millions of fans and this in reverse fetches him money. Over the years, he has sold tons of hits and earned a bunch of online streams such as YouTube, Apple Music, Itunes, and the likes which translate to money.</p><p>One of his songs “bounce” which was released on February 26, 2021, became the number one song in Nigeria with the highest streaming on Apple music in Nigeria. Music streams may only pay out fractions of a cent at a time but they bring in good money over time.</p><p>He has further released several hits which have placed him not only on Nigeria’s music map but also the world at large. In 2020, Rema’s hit track “Iron Man” gained international recognition when it was included in Former US President Barack and First lady Michelle Obama’s 2019 summer playlist.</p><h4><strong>Endorsement with Deal With HP</strong></h4><p>Rema had his first endorsement from the Information and Communications Technology and computer hardware giant Hewlett Packard (HP). It was the first of its kind and a big achievement.</p><h4><strong>Endorsement With Bayerische Motoren</strong></h4><p>Also, his new hit single “Beamer Bad Boys” got the attention of German automobile giant Bayerische Motoren popularly called BMW as it promotes their brand. He was consequently awarded and endorsed with an Honorary Fellowship of the BMW Club of Nigeria. They appreciated his free advertisement and decided to make it official.</p><h2><b>How Does Rema’s Net Worth Compare To Naira Marley’s?</b></h2><p>Rema is young in the industry and has achieved great feats within a very short time that some of his predecessors can only dream of. And when compared with the likes of Azeez Fashola, professionally known as Naira Marley, it is no wonder why they both live a lavish lifestyle.</p><p>The “Marlian” President, Naira Marley charges about N6-10 million for local functions and $60 000 – $100,000 for international shows and functions. This is a bit higher than what Rema charges to be booked for shows.</p><p>While Marley is more expensive to invite for a show or function, Rema is richer than Naira Marley. Naira Marley has a total net worth of about $700, 000, which is below Rema’s $1 million. Therefore, with a difference of over $300, 000 Marley doesn’t seem to stand a chance.</p><h3><strong>The Root of Rema’s Music Career Success</strong></h3><p>Rema’s life is different than when we first fell in love with him, and he’s got the money to show for it. However, long before now, Rema wouldn’t have thought he would be where he is today in his musical career.</p><p>He started small in Benin City of Edo State, Nigeria, singing in schools and churches. In 2018, Rema posted a viral freestyle of D’Prince’s “Gucci Gang, and it got the admiration of D’Prince, who could not keep his cool.</p><p>Rema was in Ghana when the opportunity came knocking, D’Prince who is the brother of Billionaire CEO of Mavin Records Don Jazzy asked to meet with Rema in Lagos. They met and signed a record deal under Jonzing World Records (a subsidiary of Mavin Records) in 2019. Rema released his debut EP (Extended Play) titled “Rema” the same year. It was a huge success and soon it became number one on Apple Music Nigeria.</p><p>He went on to release Freestyle, Bad Commando, Dumebi, and other club bangers that have left his fans dancing to his sweet voice and artistic mastery. Today he is recognized as a great artist and entertainer.</p><p>Rema is also a prolific rapper even though he sings more than he raps these days. His rapping skills manifested back in the day while at Christ of Mercy Church Benin. Given his skills, he was installed as the Youth Leader. At the time, he had a program called “Rap Nation” where he trained children to rap for the congregation. To date, he continues to entertain his fans widely known as “Ravers” with his rap which also fetch him some income.</p><h3><strong>He Is Also An Electrifying Performer&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Live events or performances are among the most lucrative spaces for musicians in the digital-music era. For good reasons: dedicated music fans desire closer experiences with their favorite artists. That’s why music shows – be it tours, concerts, festivals attract huge crowds with ticket sellouts even more than album sales. Artists like Rema who command some of Nigeria’s highest ticket prices have this source to thank as a substantial means of income.</p><p>Rema first started performing in church and in schools when he was coming up. Today he hasn’t stopped only that he now performs to a bigger audience and for better pay. To give you an idea of just how loaded he is, Rema charges about N7, million to grace a show or function, so booking him for a show costs a fortune.</p><p>His first stage performance as a music star was on 14th May 2019 with the Lagos Homecoming. He had a banging stage performance at the Native land Concert and the Peace of Mind live concert where he highlighted the plight of Nigerians under the scourge of COVID 19.</p><p>He was brought on stage by American Rapper Future to perform his hit tracks Lady and Dumebi. The Volta soundtrack for the 2021 FIFA World Premiere featured Rema in Beamer’s “Bad Boys”, the energetic young artist fascinated the fans with the live performance of his tracks Alien and American Love. Rema’s stage performance can be likened to those of Freddy Mercury and he has performed in different countries including Tanzania, London, etc.</p><h3><strong>He is Still Signed Under Mavin Records</strong></h3><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>The “Afro Beat Future King” Rema is still signed with Mavin’s Jonzing World Records where he is reaping the benefits of his labor. Fast-rising Nigerian act Ruger was recently unveiled as the newest member of Jonzing World Record to join Rema in making history.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHr7XGnqmimV6YvK57x6iuZqqVoq5us8CrpZ6qlZl6qbXSZqWerF2svLPAx2aYrGWRYsCqusaeqWaqkaW9pr6MmqWdZaOprqixjKmcq56fp7qmvo4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
