Cochrane's time with the band produced six studio albums, a live album, a box set, and a best-of album. The band took a break from performing together in the 1990s but some of the members, including Cochrane, reunited in 2002 and continue to occasionally perform together.</p><h2 id=life-a-highway><strong>Life is a Highway</strong></h2><p>Outside of his time with Red Rider, Cochrane also developed a very successful solo career. Because of his success with the band, Cochrane became a household name in Canada. He decided to launch his solo career in 1991 with the release of the song, "Life is a Highway." The single became a global success. It was a number one hit in Canada and charted as number six on the US Billboard Hot 100 charts. It also reached the top three in both Australia and New Zealand.
