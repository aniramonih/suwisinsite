Not once.” Emily rocked a chic black crop top and matching leggings as she <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>worked out</a> in the viral clip.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>The proud mom continued and noted how much stronger she feels following her weight loss. “I am the strongest (mentally and physically) right now … at age 47 …and I will continue to improve myself daily. My only competition is Me,” Emily wrote. Later in the caption, the Bravo personality made sure to thank her “haters” for their support as well. “Thank you for following this journey with me and for those of you who are always kind and comment positive things … I appreciate you!” she went on. “For the haters out there.. I love you too!

I have zero testosterone. I was pre-diabetic, so she [the doctor] actually said, ‘Why don’t you do a Semaglutide?’ which is Ozempic, so I did. I did that in December [2022].” She also admitted to having a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>face lift</a>, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>liposuction</a>, and a breast reduction in early 2023.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Despite being proud of her healthier fitness routine and eating habits, Emily noted that she still felt “hot” prior to the weight loss. “I don’t want to be detrimental to myself. I don’t want to say negative things about myself. I&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>have a daughter</a>. There’s women out there. You know?”, she added. “I just think it’s important that I embrace who I was at that time and now I’ve gotten healthier. I feel better about myself, but I still think I was hot.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH16e5ByZp6lmaHGbr%2FIpqesp55iwaK4yqxksJ2ZnLW1ecuoqqxlmaN6r7HWZpmenp%2Bnsm6tzZ1kmp6kmr9uvMeoq6hn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
