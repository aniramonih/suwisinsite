It was directed by Antoine Fuqua and serves as a prequel to The Equaliser 2. In it, Denzel Washington plays Robert McCall, a former DIA officer and retired US Marine who relocates to Southern Italy in an effort to leave his past behind. He soon learns that the Sicilian Mafia is in charge of his new companions.</p><p>Robert lets loose his old self now that the situation is out of control. In order to protect his buddies, he resolves the situation on his own by confronting the mob. The crime picture primarily takes place in Southern Italy and has a number of intense action scenes set against rapidly shifting landscapes, leaving viewers puzzled as to where the scenes were actually shot. We can help if you’re in the similar situation!</p><h3>The Equalizer 3 Filming Locations</h3><p>The majority of “The Equaliser 3” was shot in Italy, particularly in Campania and Rome. According to reports, filming for the Denzel Washington starrer began in the final week of September 2022 and was completed in January 2023. Filmmaker Antoine Fuqua was asked about his experience filming the movie in Italy in an August 2023 interview with Screen Rant.</p><p>“It was an amazing experience,” Fuqua said. Amazing experience. Learning the language; learning the people. Even though I’ve been there multiple times, the way I see it now is quite different because I spent six months living there. I was experiencing the various tastes of Italy while visiting Rome, Amalfi, and Naples. So, it was an amazing experience. A truly amazing experience. Here are all the particular locations where Robert McCall is seen in the thriller film, without further ado.</p><h3>Campania, Italy</h3><p>The administrative region of Campania, which is primarily in the southwestern part of the Italian peninsula, served as the backdrop for a sizable portion of “The Equaliser 3.” The action movie was shot in a number of notable locales, with the town of Amalfi serving as one of them. In addition, the city of Atrani is yet another location in Campania that is prominently featured in the film. For instance, the scene when Robert McCall is seen strolling through the Italian village’s streets was filmed at 20 Via dei Dogi.</p>View this post on Instagram<p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none href=# rel=noopener>A post shared by G. ✨ (@gaiascodellaro)</a></p><p>Atrani’s Bar Antico Caffè Vittoria, located at Via Supportico Marinella, 4, was the setting for another scene in which McCall inquires about the murder that occurred on a nearby farm. Late in August 2023, Moviefone asked Fuqua to explain his decision to use Italy as the setting for Robert McCall’s story. He said, “The producers, the writer, and I have always wanted to take Robert McCall overseas. He undoubtedly lived in a variety of locations <a href=#>around the world</a> in his previous existence, in my opinion.</p>View this post on Instagram<p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none href=# rel=noopener>A post shared by Lucia Zotti (@luciazottiofficial)</a></p><p>Italy just felt natural because Denzel and I both travel there frequently, continued Fuqua. I desired a location where he would be at ease, feel at home, and be able to communicate. The Amalfi Coast is therefore not only perfect, but it’s also incredibly attractive. It was crucial to us that the location where we shot, Atrani, seemed old-world and transported viewers back in antiquity.</p><p>Before moving the production to Naples in late November 2022, the production crew shot the movie at a number of different locations, including Positano, Ravello, Minori, and Maiori. The cast and crew were seen filming several sequences in and around Naples’ Piazza del Gesù Nuovo in particular.</p><h3>Rome, Italy</h3><p>After wrapping up filming in Campania, the ‘The Equaliser 3′ film crew moved to Rome to begin shooting. They made use of the Cinecittà Studios’ resources, which are located at 1055 Via Tuscolana in Rome. The film studio occupies 400,000 square metres and has 19 sound stages, 400 offices, dressing rooms, hair and makeup areas and a 100,000 square metre backlot with four permanent sets. With all these features, Cinecittà Studios becomes a good location for various productions to film.</p>View this post on Instagram<p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none href=# rel=noopener>A post shared by Daniele Perrone (@danieleperrone__)</a></p><a class=m-a-box-avatar-url href=#><img width=150 height=150 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/logo-Finale.png alt="where was the equalizer filmed,equalizer 3 trailer,equalizer 3 release date,the equalizer 2 filming locations,equalizer 3 plot,equalizer 3 robert mccall is taking on,equalizer 3 villain,where to watch equalizer 3,cast of the equalizer 3,the equalizer 3 filming locations,what city was the equalizer filmed in" itemprop=image style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><h5><a class=m-a-box-name-url href=#>DCS</a></h5><a href=# class=m-a-box-data-toggle><span class=m-a-box-string-more-posts>+ posts</span></a><p>Our Team DCS includes 5 different writers proficient in English and research based Content Writing.
