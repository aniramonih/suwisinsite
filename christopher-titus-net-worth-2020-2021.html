He shot to stardom after featuring as the lead character in the eponymous sitcom Titus, which he also co-created. Since 2011, he’s been running a podcast along with his wife, whose catchphrase is “Never unbiased, always unbalanced.”</p><p>Maybe you know about Christopher Titus very well, but do you know how old and tall is he&nbsp;and what is his net worth in 2024? If you do not know, we have prepared this article about&nbsp;details of Christopher Titus’s short biography-wiki, career, professional life, personal life, today’s net worth, age, height, weight, and more facts. Well, if you’re ready, let’s start.</p><h2>Early Life and&nbsp;Biography:</h2><p>Born on October 1, 1964, in Castro Valley, Newark California, Christopher Todd Titus was raised by a set of parents whose constant squabbling over trifles led to their divorce while he was still a child. Both his father and mother fought for his custody, but the former had the upper hand most of the time.</p><p>His father’s promiscuous nature and his mother’s schizophrenic tendencies would later provide most of the subtext for his quips and quotes. Hailing from a broken, dysfunctional family, it’s no surprise he took to alcohol and drugs as a teenager. The volte-face from tragedy to comedy came after he fell into a bonfire at a beach party and somehow survived. In his own words, that was when he had his epiphany.</p><h2>Personal&nbsp;Life:</h2><p>In 1988, Christopher started seeing Erin Carden with whom he tied the knot on April 17, 11991. The couple had two beautiful daughters, Kennie Marie Titus and Jett Evan Titus. Sadly, they got divorced fifteen years later, an event that inspired his show, “Love is Evol.” Thereafter, he met another woman named Rachel Bradley. The couple got hitched on August 11, 2013, and together run the podcast mentioned beforehand.</p><h2>Age, Weight, and Height:</h2><p>Being born on 1 October 1964, Christopher Titus&nbsp;is 59 years old as of today’s date 21st July 2024. His height is 1.88 m&nbsp;tall, and his weight is 80 kg.</p><h2>Career:</h2><p>After having his epiphany, Christopher went on to make his mark in the realm of dark comedy. His one-man shows are based greatly on his own life.</p><p>The sitcom “Titus”&nbsp;was an overnight success and turned him into a global celebrity, receiving scores of rave reviews.</p><p>His second show,&nbsp;“The Fifth Annual End of the World Tour,”&nbsp;was inspired by his visit to Iraq in 2007. It addresses sensitive topics like the Iraq war, pedophilia, and racism. It also provides a political analysis of George Bush Jr’s administration tactics. Interestingly enough, it also explores Christopher’s relationship with his late father.</p><p>“Love is Evol”&nbsp;was inspired by his first divorce and the events leading up to it. In other words, he deconstructs his own failed relationship with his first wife and offers brilliant insights into marriage and family. In his own words, “This show will either fix your relationship or destroy it, and either way, you’re welcome.”</p><p>“Revolution”&nbsp;is a politico-social discourse on the American nation, its notorious present, and its glorious past. This special is specifically directed at prisoners and “spoiled American brats.”</p><p>“Voice in My Head” follows a series of anecdotes about personal screw-ups, including the one about how he used to play Darth Vader for children’s birthday parties.</p><p>“Angry Pursuit of Happiness”&nbsp;takes on the various world problems and how to tackle them. It runs the gamut of life itself in an attempt to uncover deeper truths.</p><p>Currently, he, along with his wife Rachel Bradley, airs a weekly podcast from “The Combustion Lounge.” The show usually starts with a prerecorded monologue by Titus in the form of a comedic rant called “The Armageddon Update,” which serves as an introduction into the topic of the day. Its motto is “Never unbiased, always unbalanced.”</p><h2>Awards and Achievements:</h2><p>Besides garnering acclaim for his comedic acts and sitcom, he has also bagged several glittering awards, including the 2017 Festival Award for best comedy feature, and the 2017 Jury Prize for best direction.</p><p>He was also nominated for the 2000 OFTA Television Award for best actor in a new comedy series, and 2002 WGA Award for episodic comedy.</p><h2>Net Worth and Salary&nbsp;of Christopher Titus in 2024</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wealthypersons.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Christopher-Titus-Net-Worth.jpg><p>Thanks to his lucrative career as a successful comedian and actor, Christopher has an estimated net worth of $1 million as of 2024.&nbsp;&nbsp;He continues to mint money from endless reruns of his ever-popular sitcom Titus.</p><p>“I don’t fail,” says Christopher Titus. “I succeed at finding out what doesn’t work for me.” From witnessing heated altercations between his parents and battling family crises as a teenage drug addict to taking the world by storm with one after another stellar one-man show, he has come a long way. He continues to enjoy the limelight and has assembled quite an extensive fan base.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uLHApauhsaCav7S7zaxlnKedZLCpvsisq6iomJq%2FbsDIraysZZ6awW7DzquroWViZX9xeZFpaWpn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
