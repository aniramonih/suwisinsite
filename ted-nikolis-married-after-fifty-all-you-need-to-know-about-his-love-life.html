They have been in contact since that time. However, the precise day they began dating has yet to be revealed. The couple used to go on dates, have meals, and attend events, but they always kept their relationship under wraps. Before their wedding, the pair dated for many years. When he married his wife, she was 52 years old.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/voxhour.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Ted-Nikolis-1.jpg><p>Ted Nikolis married his long-term partner, Lauren Green, on May 2, 2015. The couple also got engaged in the same year. They mustered the bravery to marry at the age of fifty. Even though his birth date is not yet known. We think he was beyond the age of fifty at the time. It was not a traditional wedding but an example for those who are hesitant to begin a new life beyond a certain age. When it comes to pure love, age is only a number for this couple.</p><h2>Had Happily Ever After Party</h2><p>The couple had a large Greek wedding in New York, with relatives and friends in attendance. The couple married on Saturday and celebrated their ‘Happily Ever After with a large ‘Happily Ever After’ party that evening. Only a few family members attended the gathering. The celebration was hosted at the home of his sister-in-law (Lois). After then, the party combined with birthday festivities. The first party was held outside the house, but due to mosquito bites, it had to be moved inside.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/voxhour.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Ted-Nikolis-2.jpg><p>The newlywed pair participated in a variety of activities, including Q&A. It’s a game in which we ask the groom and bride questions about each other, and whoever gets it correctly wins. However, his wife, a 90-year-old mother, stole the show and became the talk of the town by wearing thin jeans to the celebration.</p><h2>No children—might adopt one.</h2><p>His wife is now the Fox News Channel’s Chief Religion Correspondent.&nbsp;The couple does not have any children, but due to the age difference, they may consider adopting one. For the last five years, the pair has been blissfully married and established.&nbsp;Furthermore, there have been no prior reports of their being affiliated with anybody.&nbsp;Ted Nikolis’s former life and relationships are not now available to the public since he is highly cautious about his private life.</p><h2>Net worth</h2><p>Ted Nikolis’s net worth is unknown, although <strong>his wife (Lauren Green) is reported to be around $2 million as of January 2024.</strong> Lauren’s yearly income might be $122,000; however, this is simply an estimation; the actual value could be different.&nbsp;Her principal source of revenue comes from her work as a top anchor, host, and correspondent. She is also interested in music. She is well known for her album “Classic Beauty.”</p><h2>Trivia.</h2><ul><li>His wife (Lauren Green) won the Miss Minnesota Pageant in 1984.</li><li>His wife belongs to the African Methodist Episcopal Church.</li></ul><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiun621sMHRZ5qopV%2BpsqV5zaKiqKSZqHqurdGroJ6cXZaztbHRZp2inqSueqK4y2awqK1do7KmsIytpmajnqTEbq3BqKytZZiewG64zq%2BcZqSZm7Jw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
