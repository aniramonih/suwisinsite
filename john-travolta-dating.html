If you want to know who John Travolta’s new girlfriend is, who his wife is, who he has dated in the past, and who he is dating now, this article will tell you everything you need to know.</p><p>But first, let me tell you some more personal things about John Travolta. You will know everything about his life and how he dates.</p><h2>Who Is John Travolta?</h2><p>In 1954, on February 18, a baby boy was born. His name was John Joseph Travolta. This star was born in the US, but he became the most famous actor and singer of the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s.</p><p>In the mid-1970s, he had a big part in the sitcom Welcome Back, Kotter, which ran from 1975 to 1979. This was the start of his career. These four years of acting brought him to the attention of Hollywood, and he was soon in almost every big movie of the late 1970s.</p><p>In 1976, he was in the movie “Carrie.” Then, in Saturday Night Fever, he played the role of Tony Monero. Reviews say that it did a good job of showing the character. Movies like “<a href=# rel=noopener>Urban Cowboy</a>” and “Grease” put him at the top of the list as one of Hollywood’s most loved and sought-after actors by the end of the decade.</p><p>In the 1980s, he didn’t act in as many movies, so his career moved along much more slowly. After he was in Urban Cowboy in 1980, he tried out for the lead role in Blown Out, which was made by Brian de Palma in 1981. Even though the movie got good reviews from critics, it didn’t do well at the box office and was a total flop.</p><p>This was the start of a string of bad commercials and movies that made John Travolta’s career in the 1980s a rough ride. During this time, he kept getting fewer and fewer movie parts, and it seemed like his career had reached its peak and was now going downhill.</p><p>In the 1990s, he was in big hits like Pulp Fiction (1994), Get Shorty (1995), Broken Arrow (1996), Face Off (1997), A Civil Action (1998), and Primary Colors (1999). (1998). He didn’t stop there and is still important in Hollywood to this day. John is still in movies with some of the highest-paid actors in the business.</p><p>The actor and singer are worth more than $250 million and have about four private planes. He is said to make just under $2 million a month and more than $20 million a year in salary.</p><p>Since 1975, John Travolta has been a member of the Church of Scientology and has done a lot of work for charity. Bringing aid and relief to countries at war, and he flew his Boeing 737s to these troubled places to make the deliveries himself. People also say that he is very open-minded and always looking for ways to help.</p><h2>Olivia Newton-John And John Travolta</h2><p>In the late 1970s and 1980s, when movies were becoming more popular than they used to be, Hollywood really took off as the top film industry. Of course, movie stars were also a big part of why Hollywood was so popular at that time.</p><p>Legendary actors like John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John quickly gained a lot of fans because of how passionately they played their roles. Both as a whole business and as individuals. As their fame grew, fans became more interested in what they did in their personal lives. Even though the media wasn’t as open to news as it is now, the lives of some of the most famous and interesting actors were still in the public eye. Even against their will sometimes.</p><p>In the 1980s and 1990s, dating might have been seen as a longer-term commitment than it is today. That didn’t stop these actors from dating controversial people and having more than one partner. Just like the famous actor John Travolta.</p><p>In 1978, the movie Grease brought fans their favorite couple for the first time. Olivia Newton-John and John Travolta. They played Sandy and Danny, a couple who came from very different places but fell in love during the summer break.</p><p></p><p>When it was time to go back to their own lives after the break, they saw that they were very different, but they still managed to make it work. People thought that the two actors in the movie would be great together because of how well they worked together on screen.</p><p>This wasn’t true, though, because both actors said they weren’t in a relationship or even interested in each other romantically. They said that it was for reasons only they knew, but that they wanted what was best for each other. They were able to keep the romance on the big screen. Even though Olivia admitted that she had a huge crush on her co-star John Travolta, they never went beyond being good friends.</p><p>Olivia Newton-John died on August 8, 2022, when she was 73 years old. She left a big hole in the music and movie industries, and she will always be remembered as a legend who stood up for and spoke out for the LGBTQ+ community.</p><p>If you are interested in knowing other celebrities’ dating life then you may like these articles:</p><h2><span id=Who_Is_John_Travolta8217s_First_Wife>Who Is John Travolta’s First Wife?</span></h2><p>Diana Hyland was John Travolta’s, first love.

Possibly more.</p><p>John and Kelly met in 1990, and by 1991, they were happy enough with each other to get married.
