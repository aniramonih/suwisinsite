So you know how much this means to me. You’re gonna make me cry. But I just really can’t say thank you enough, because it’s not lost on me. Your time, your attention, the fact that you paid to come here; I really hope you had a good time. I really love you, I really do. I appreciate you.”</p><p>As she continues on the 17-city North American trek, which she’s scheduled to close in Los Angeles on March 22, <a class=underline-link href=#>SZA has announced plans for a deluxe version of her record-breaking sophomore effort</a>, which has spent a total of 10 weeks at the No. 1 position on&nbsp;Billboard‘s Hot 200 Albums chart since its release in December.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>The New Jersey singer was <a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>crowned&nbsp;Billboard‘s Woman of the Year</a>, and in an&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>interview with the publication</a>&nbsp;said she’s grateful for the success&nbsp;SOS has achieved since it dropped.</p><p>“Right now, I just have extreme gratitude because I swear to God, I never thought I’d be No. 1 for even a week, let alone seven,” the 33-year-old said.
