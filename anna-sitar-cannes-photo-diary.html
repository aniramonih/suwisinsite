Did she ever think she'd be attending such a prestigious event? How did she decide on what to wear? And is it too late for other creatives to follow in her footsteps? She graciously gave us all the details along with some life advice, all while making sure to show off her best poses and highlight the back of her gorgeous Brandon Maxwell gown.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-is-it-like-to-be-attending-cannes></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_4-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What is it like to be attending Cannes?</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Pierre Mouton</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It feels like living in a movie.

In comparison to any event before, this process was lively. My hotel door remained open as photographers and journalists wandered in and out to help document the experience. It felt out of body to meet and collaborate with so many incredibly talented individuals. Normally I would have music playing, but whenever I have a makeup and hair artist with me, I prefer to visit with them, hear about their journey in their career, or favorite opportunities they've been a part of. Part of it is my midwest friendliness, and the other part is my genuine curiosity about everyone's own lives and what happens in their day to day.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-can-you-tell-us-about-your-hair-and-makeup></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Can you tell us about your hair and makeup?</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-low-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Pierre Mouton</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Simple, natural, glowing as always. I was hoping to emulate a refreshed and sun-kissed look without overpowering the dress. Since I recently cut my hair, it was a difficult decision of if we should do an updo or leave it down and teased. But with the high neckline, the low bun and curtain bangs seemed like an obvious decision.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-are-some-outfit-details-we-might-not-notice-at-first-glance></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What are some outfit details we might not notice at first glance?</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-low-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Pierre Mouton</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">My favorite element of the dress was the back. It just added extra elegance and complemented the dress perfectly. This color felt crisp and refreshing. That detail added surprise and spice to the look. It felt ideal for Southern France in May. With the crisp, geometric cut of the dress and the hair and makeup, we leaned into an Old Hollywood moment. Maybe even a small nod to completing my film and television Masters Program.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-jewelry-did-you-choose-wear></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What jewelry did you choose wear?</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-low-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Pierre Mouton</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Given the gravity of this red carpet, I wanted to keep my jewelry personal. Most of the pieces I wore to the event I wear every day — they have been gifted or collected over the years. It makes me feel like my special people are with me in these big moments.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-do-you-balance-creating-great-content-while-also-remembering-to-enjoy-the-moment></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How do you balance creating great content while also remembering to enjoy the moment?</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Pierre Mouton</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I really value the prep time before creating content.

My intention has always been to create. I wanted to share beautiful moments in life and document this crazy journey, whether it is travel, school, work, or relationships. Next for me is continuing what I love. I am in the middle of production for a clothing line I have been working on for the last several months. I am writing, enjoying the quiet since recently graduating with my Masters Degree, and hoping to spend the coming months perfecting my craft, video making, and still fitting some adventures in the mix."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-advice-do-you-have-for-people-thinking-its-too-late-to-achieve-your-type-of-success></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What advice do you have for people thinking it's too late to achieve your type of success?</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-low-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Pierre Mouton</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It's never too late and at no point are you stuck. You can decide to completely turn your life around tomorrow. There's this beautiful element to life where there are no rules. I used to think that life would go in a straight line, but sometimes taking the most unexpected turn leads to the best adventures. Your career doesn't have to make sense, but it has to be full of decisions you're proud of, and you never want to look back and regret not taking the leap.
