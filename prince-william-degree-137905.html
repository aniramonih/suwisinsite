During a 2010 interview with The Telegraph, Kate said that she “went bright red and scuttled off, feeling very shy” after their first encounter.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/kate-middleton-prince-william.png><p>For his part, <a href=#>William told the outlet that he was infatuated with Kate</a> from the moment he met her. “We just spent more time together, we had a good giggle and realized we shared some interests,” the now-dad-of-two once said of their first few years of dating. “She has a normal sense of humor which is really good for me because I’ve got a dead sense of humor, and things happened.”</p><p>And now, things couldn’t be better for the couple!

While he’s served in the British military and has devoted much of his time to charity work, many are often left wondering what the 35-year-old studied while attending St. Andrew’s. Well, it turns out that in June 2005, William earned a Scottish master’s degree (the equivalent of a US bachelor’s degree) in geography after four years. Most recently, Will has put his education to use as a helicopter pilot with the East Anglian Air Ambulance organization. However, we guess you can say William also got a degree in love…</p><p>Join our <a href=#>Facebook group</a> for the latest updates on Kate Middleton, Prince William, and all things royal!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46pqaKmk5p6uLXLpaCapV2Zsqi%2BxJ5kamtnbn12ew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
