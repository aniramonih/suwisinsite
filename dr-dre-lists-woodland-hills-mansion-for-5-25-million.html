The house, all 16,200 square feet of it, cost Dre a little less than $2.4 million back in 1999, and now he's looking to sell it for $5.25 million – so not a bad deal, especially considering the 20 years of inflation that's taken place in between now and when he bought it.</p><p>Casa Dre has eight bedrooms and a lucky 13 bathrooms, nestled underneath the Woodland Hills and behind a gate and imposing drive. It boasts an equally imposing three floors, all of them serviced by a private elevator, as well as a large master suite with at least enough space to accommodate musician Dre's baby grand piano (no word on whether that's included in the asking price or not). That master suite also includes not just one but two bathrooms as well as a hair/makeup salon.</p><p>The home's grand foyer is what Variety calls "the size of a shopping-mall atrium," and outdoors you'll find a an "Olympic length saltwater pool" and stone patio complete with fireplace. There's a home theater room, a gym, a dine-in full kitchen as well as a kitchenette upstairs, and in the game room a very cool touch in the form of a 150-gallon fish tank. There's also an attached guesthouse with its own kitchenette and separate entrance. Only Dre knows the kinds of big names that have probably spent the night in those rooms over the last 20 years.</p><p>Dre's G-Funk empire includes quite a bit of real estate holdings, including a <a href=#>Brentwood mansion he purchased for $50 million in 2014</a>, but this one must hold a lot of memories since he's owned it going back to 1999. But all things must pass, and now he's letting it go, provided he can find a buyer. For your part, you can take a look at the House The Chronic Built in the video below from Forward Living Media:</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcK%2FEpZybqpmpxm60zqacrGeUp3qlvsRmo6KrpKh6uLvOnaOappRitaq4y6xkppmeqLawuoyfpqtlZWJ%2FdnnMoqOloZ%2BjfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
