And Surprisingly, Brett agreed to it, and the rest is history.&nbsp;</p><p>His dad was a partner in the Destiny Homes home-building company based in Waukee, Iowa. After his son began showing interest in racing, Dick gave all the time to Brett in order to work on his practices.</p><p>His dad has been by his side since the beginning and has attended almost all the races he has participated in his career to date. Both son and dad accept that the sport strengthened their bonding.</p><p>Unfortunately, there is not much information about his mother, Becky, except that she is a housewife.&nbsp;</p><h2>Brett Is A Married Man</h2><p>The NASCAR Xfinity Series driver is married to his longtime girlfriend, Stephanie Moffitt. Based on his <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a> posts, the two probably started dating in 2018.</p><p>Stephanie is originally from North Carolina and celebrates her birthday in July.
