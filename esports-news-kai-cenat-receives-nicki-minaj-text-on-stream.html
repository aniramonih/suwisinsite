Despite winning the Streamer of the Year, Kai has received unnecessary bans from Twitch. Kai recently threatened Twitch during a stream to switch platforms if this mistreatment continues. Kai has garnered a huge fan following since his last 30 days subscribers marathon in February 2023. People are speculating&nbsp;that the streamer is moving to Kick, but it&nbsp;hasn’t been&nbsp;confirmed&nbsp;yet.</p><p>The streamer has been in the news too much these days, and it doesn’t seem to end. During a recent stream, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kai</a> suddenly flipped his chair and ran across the room. This baffled the&nbsp;viewers. The reason for this behavior of Kai was a text from the popular rapper Nicki Minaj!</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Nicki Minaj texted Kai thinking he’s in New York for a Stream🤯🤯🤯🔥🔥<br>The Barbz x Mafia stream is incoming👀 <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/vfFpTKgaXI</a></p>— Kai Mafia Updates🗽💫 (@Kaimafiaupdates) <a href=#>May 8, 2023</a></figure><p><strong>Related: </strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“What the f**k,” Kai Cenat loses it after seeing Kevin Gate’s Instagram story</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-nicki-minaj-x-kai-cenat-a-collab-stream-coming-soon><strong>Nicki Minaj x Kai Cenat: A collab stream coming soon</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/firstsportz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-05-08-5-1024x576.png><p>During Kai’s stream on May 8, he suddenly received a text on his phone and jumped out of his chair. Kai ran around his room, screaming ‘shut the f*ck up’ over and over. As viewers were speculating the reason for his behavior, Kai screamed that he got a text from Nicki Minaj. This claim astonished the viewers. And the chat flooded with replies and messages.</p><p>Moreover, Kai was overly restless over this development. Considering how famous <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Nicki Minaj</a> is as a rapper, a collab stream with her is a dream for many streamers. In the text, Nicki asked Kai whether he’s in New York for a stream. This clearly indicated how Nicki is the one to approach the streamer for a stream and not the other way around.</p><p>Also, in her message, Nicki mentioned, “Are things good between you and Twitch?” This shows how Twitch’s mistreatment of Kai has spread everywhere. Twitch and its Community Guidelines bind him despite the popularity of his live streams. But regardless, we’ll be seeing Kai Cenat and Nicki Minaj together on a stream very soon.</p><p>Fans and even the famous streamer <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Adin Ross</a> have urged the streamer to change platforms. The new Twitch alternate, Kick, is flourishing, and many streamers are already migrating to it. Considering how Twitch is treating its streamers and giving them unnecessary bans here and there, migration is looking like the most viable option right now. Well, that decision is something totally personal to a streamer. All we can hope for is a collab stream of Kai Cenat and Nicki Minaj being pulled off successfully.</p><p>In case you missed it:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiemafAtb%2FPqKmtsl6YvK57xKynqKqkqHqvsdasZKSZmWKwprrArWSrnZOatrex0malopubnnqutc2aoWasla3BbrvNZqqtqpWWunA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
