Atkinson, 46, had chartered the twin-prop Cessna to take him, his wife Sunetra and their two children, Ben, eight, and Lily, six, on a 75-minute journey between Mombasa and Nairobi. Noticing that the pilot had closed his eyes and slumped back in his seat, the comedian and his wife moved to the front of the plane and tried to revive him."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

A few minutes later the pilot regained consciousness, apparently unaware of what had happened. The Atkinson family's holiday journey to Wilson Airport in Nairobi last month continued without a hitch and they landed safely.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbHLnp6rmaCde6S7ja6iaKaVrMBww86ro52mlazAcK3Fq6CcmZGjsaq6w6KYp6eTmq6ve8qepbKZX2aAc4OVcmdohaJij6atzWadpaGVqHqxuMCnnGaZlqmys3nPoqOorF2brqq606xloaydoQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
