Theresa Caputo, 55 has divorced her husband of 31 years Larry Caputo, 64. Fans of the long island star were hoping that the two would reconcile their differences.
But it seems that the two have made a hard decision to permanently go their separate ways. Six months ago in December, the stars had confirmed the rumors that they were getting a divorce on an episode of her show."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

We’re in divorce proceedings so that’s been going on for the past six months. It’s not finalized. I don’t know when it will be but that’s where we’re at. I’m doing fine. I know she’s doing well. I’m happy. We’ve moved on with our lives.”</p><p>Larry also has revealed he moved to Los Angeles at the end of September and has lived on the West Coast ever since. Whereas, Theresa is staying on the East Coast, in New York.</p><p>Theresa also had some things to say about the failed marriage,</p><p>“Things at home have been really stressful lately and Larry and I have hit a bump in our relationship. And unfortunately, the truth is we’re considering spending some time apart. So, I’ve been trying to get my mind off of things by being more adventurous.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Theresa-Caputo.jpg><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_blame></span><span>The blame</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Larry also added that their busy schedule played a role in the downward spiral of their marriage. He explained their situation to the fans,</p><p>“We’re having a difficult time. I think a lot of the frustration has to do with us not spending the time together anymore. Along with that comes the lack of communication so it’s like losing your best friend. It’s hard.”</p><p>However, Theresa has not commented on how the happy marriage ended in divorce.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Theresa-Caputo-3.jpg><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Time_Heals></span><span>Time Heals</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>As time heals all wounds, Larry has revealed that he is back. He is dating again! He shared,</p><p>“I’m fortunate enough to say I have met someone special but I’ll just leave it at that for now.”</p><p>And Theresa continues to tour the country as a part of Theresa Caputo Live!&nbsp;Experience. The tour will last until the end of this year. She seems to be keeping things busy to keep her mind off things.</p><p>The couple had married in 1989 and have two children together, Larry Jr, 27, and Victoria, 26. Theresa thanked her fans for their support and well wishes after the news of the split spread.</p><p>She had tweeted last December,</p><p>“I’m overwhelmed by the love and support for me and my whole family while we’re going through this difficult time. One thing will never change and that is that we will always love and support each other and be the best parents we can be to our children. Love you guys XOXO.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Theresa-Caputo-2.jpg><p>Share this</p><strong>Disclaimer Statement</strong>: Married Biography's editors wrote and updated all of this data based on their best knowledge and understanding. <a href=#>Married Biography</a> does not guarantee these opinions or ideas.
