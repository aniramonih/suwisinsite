His first job was handling the A&R for his older brother Akon’s multi-platinum album, Trouble. In 2005, he signed T-Pain.

As Senegal is his father’s home, he founded one of Senegal’s biggest internet service providers in September 2018.

He was previously in a relationship with Ariel Hakim in 2010. Bu and Ariel share a daughter and he used to provide $3000 per month for child care to Ariel. After two years, she demanded more money as she had another place left with her daughter without providing Abou with the required 30-day notice. As a result, he backfired on Ariel by claiming that her behavior violated his right to visitation.</p><p>Bu and Tracee Ellis Ross had a committed relationship starting in 2011. Their romance only lasted until 2013. But he claims that he is still in love with her and that his future lovers should understand.
