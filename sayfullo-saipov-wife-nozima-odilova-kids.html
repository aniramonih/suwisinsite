He said he attacked ISIS and left a note in the truck promising to follow the group.</p><p>Before the incident, Saipov came to the United States in 2010 using the Diversity Visa Lottery program. This program gives visas to people from countries that have had low immigration rates to the U.S. in the past. He lived in different places and had a job driving trucks.</p><p>After he was caught, Saipov went through a legal process. He didn’t seem very sorry for what he did.

These things can help us understand him better, but we can’t find them because they’re not public.</p><p>Every person has connections with others that affect their life. However, Saipov cannot connect these threads and has many unanswered questions.</p><p>As people deal with the consequences of his terrible actions, the fact that his family is not around anymore is felt strongly in his past. What made him think the way he does, and who helped him along the way?</p><p>However, throughout history, people have stopped talking about his origins. The bad things he did were getting attention, and his family is being ignored and can’t speak up because of all the suffering.</p><p>Also Read: <a href=#>Hunter Gundlach, Alex Pataska And Brady Hove- Teens Arrested For Terroristic Threats</a></p><h2>Where is Sayfullo Saipov Now?</h2><p>Sayfullo Saipov, who committed a terrible terrorist attack in New York City in 2017, is now in federal prison.
