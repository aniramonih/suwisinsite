Despite this, his death was ruled accidental.</p><p>When the police arrived at the scene, they found an unfinished sentence on an electric typewriter and a kettle of boiling water. Bruce had allegedly written, “Conspiracy to interfere with the 4th Amendment const…” in a letter to the Los Angeles Times. An accidental morphine overdose was determined as the cause of his death. He was in his forties.</p><p>Some attributed Bruce’s tragic end to his relentless legal battles and hailed him as a martyr of free speech. Remarkably, in 2003, New York Governor George E.
