He&nbsp;lived primarily with his mother while he was growing up, seeing his father only occasionally. When Scott Eastwood became a teenager, however, he moved in with his father.</p><p id=par-4_49>Unlike some famous offspring, Scott Eastwood achieved his success by working hard instead of relying on <a href=#>familial ties</a>. The hard work has paid off; since he began acting in 2006,&nbsp;he has appeared in a handful of notable roles. Today, Scott Eastwood is famous for more than his last name.</p><h2>What is Scott Eastwood’s net worth?</h2><p id=par-5_1></p><p id=par-6_66>According to <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Scott Eastwood is worth $10 million. He earns most his money through acting roles and endorsement deals. Although Scott Eastwood spent his formative years “being dragged around to movie sets,” his successful career as an actor and a model&nbsp;wasn’t just handed to him by his father.&nbsp;Clint Eastwood made his son work to earn whatever he wanted, from vehicles to acting roles.</p><p id=par-7_88>Scott Eastwood’s first acting job was in 2006’s Flags of our Fathers, which was&nbsp;directed by his father, but nepotism&nbsp;played no part&nbsp;in him getting the role.&nbsp;Clint Eastwood makes his son audition for roles just like everyone else, and he rarely gets the part. The second-generation actor told Conan O’Brien that&nbsp;he’s&nbsp;not sure his father even wants him in his movies.&nbsp;“I don’t think he likes me in his movies. Here’s the thing, he’s put me in a few movies. I’ve auditioned for a lot and haven’t gotten a lot,” he said.</p><p id=par-8_35>The handsome star has appeared in television shows like Chicago Fire and&nbsp;Chicago PD, and movies like&nbsp;The Long Ride, Snowden,&nbsp;Suicide Squad,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Pacific Rim: Uprising.&nbsp;He is also known for his role as Little Nobody in&nbsp;Fate of the Furious.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=par-9_20>Besides acting, Scott Eastwood also earns money from endorsement deals, such as the deal he signed with BMW in 2017.</p><h2>Scott Eastwood struggled with his famous last name</h2><p id=par-11_52>Before Scott Eastwood became a successful actor, he did not merely&nbsp;coast by on his daddy’s money. Clint Eastwood may be worth <a href=#>$375 million</a>, but <a href=#>he&nbsp;made his son work to earn a living</a>. “My dad never gave me a cent. He made me work for everything,”&nbsp;he told&nbsp;Men’s Health&nbsp;during an interview in May 2015.</p><p id=par-12_79>That work ethic came in handy when Scott Eastwood first pursued a career in acting. He told&nbsp;Men’s Health his last name was an obstacle at first. “I came [to Hollywood]&nbsp;to try and do something and nobody took me seriously. Everyone brushed me off, like, ‘You’re Clint Eastwood’s son, you’re not a real f**king actor.’ Some people are still like that. I never thought I would last in this business, but it finally seems to be working out,” he stated.</p><p id=par-13_26>Scott Eastwood overcame this obstacle by&nbsp;taking his mother’s maiden name. He was&nbsp;credited as Scott Reeves until 2009, when he appeared as Scott Eastwood in 2009’s&nbsp;Shannon’s Rainbow.</p><h2>Scott Eastwood’s next projects</h2><p id=par-14_55>You can catch Scott Eastwood on the big screen in 2019. According to <a href=#>IMDB</a>, he will star alongside Orlando Bloom in&nbsp;The Outpost, which is currently&nbsp;filming and due to be released in 2019. Following&nbsp;The Outpost,&nbsp;Scott Eastwood will&nbsp;star&nbsp;in&nbsp;The Manuscript&nbsp;with Morgan Freeman and Jamie Foxx. The film is currently&nbsp;in pre-production, and a release date has not been announced.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS1sMOMpqycoF2ewG6vy6KlrWWVlsC1w86om6xlo6S7br%2FCqKutZZWWwLXDzqibZq%2Bfp8GpesetpKVn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
