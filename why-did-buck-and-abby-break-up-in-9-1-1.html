Abby’s newfound freedom threatens her relationship with Buck. He initially waits for her return to reunite with her but eventually, the firefighter realizes that Abby isn’t coming back. He starts to believe that she ghosted him, which makes him finalize their breakup for good. In the third season, Abby returns to Buck’s life but with a fiancé. She makes it clear that she moved on from their relationship. The former couple ends their meeting after deciding to remain friends.</p><p>According to co-creator Tim Minear, Abby’s European journey changes her severely, which influences her decision to break up with Buck. “For Abby, Buck was the thing that helped dislodge her from the rut that she was in and allowed her to go off on this adventure to discover who she was,” Minear told <a href=#>TVLine</a>. “The danger of going somewhere and discovering who you are is discovering who you are. You may not come back as the same person, which is what happened with Abby,” he added. When she makes progress in her journey, Abby’s priorities and feelings for Buck change, which makes her ghost him. “[…] she [Abby] went off and basically ghosted him [Buck]. That’s how he felt about it,” the co-creator clarified.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/1667913165539-e1667913390133.jpg><p>Since Connie Britton joined the cast of the series only for the first season, Buck and Abby’s break up seemingly was always part of the plans. The writers must have conceived the same to depict Buck’s transition from a hothead to a mature man. “Buck feels mature to me at the end of that story. He feels like a guy who realizes that a chapter is over. It did them both some good, and he can’t be angry at her. In fact, while he thought that his metaphorical train might have jumped the tracks, he’s not at the end of the line. He’s still on his journey,” Minear added in the same TVLine interview.</p><p>Buck’s time with Abby makes him realize that he is capable of nurturing a committed relationship. Such a realization leads him to his relationship with <a href=#>Taylor Kelly</a>. Although they do not end up together, Buck succeeds in saying to himself that he doesn’t have to limit himself to casual sexual encounters.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwqrrEppihp5yesG%2BvzqZmsKCpYrGqsIybrJyjXZa7pXnAm5myZZKnsqK3jK6nZqGeYoZufYxqZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
