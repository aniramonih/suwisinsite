He is of African American ethnicity and American nationality. While his mother’s name is Sherhonda Gaulden, the name of his father is not known. However, at the time he was born, it seems as though his parents were already married.</p><p>He was brought up together with two siblings, mostly by his grandmother, Alice Gaulden. His mom was also there while he was growing up, but his father was absent all through as he was locked up when the young teenager was less than five years old.</p><p>As revealed by his older brother in a song and <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>later in a post</a>, their father got involved in a robbery gone wrong, and it was for this reason that he was kept behind bars where he is on a 55 years sentence. His mother decided to get a divorce from his father after he was incarcerated, but it has not been made known if she has been married again, although she has not had any other child after Ken.</p><p>The childhood of the youngest, Gaulden, was a very difficult one as he got exposed to crime at a very young age, growing up in a crime-infested neighborhood. His educational journey has not yet been made known.</p><h2><strong>Ken Gaulden Has Three Brothers and a Sister</strong></h2><p>Ken Gaulden is the youngest of his mother’s children, but his father has another kid. He was brought up together with three brothers and a sister. The oldest of the siblings is his sister, Teelee Gaulden, who was born on January 15, 1997, in Baton Rogue.</p><p>Now 26 years old, she is also a musical artist and social media star who is most popularly referred to as SimplyTeelee. She is not as famous as NBA YoungBoy, but she has also gone a long way in her career with several popular songs, including Dying Inside (2019) and Bad Guy (2022).</p><p>The most famous of the Siblings is Kentrell DeSean Gaulden, who most people would recognize as <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>NBA YoungBoy</a>. The American rapper was born on October 20, 1999, which means he is now 24 years old. The Baton Rouge-born rapper is often referred to as YoungBoy Never Broke Again. He had a very difficult childhood that saw him dropping out of school and taking to the streets. NBA YoungBoy started his career in 2015 and has come to be famous for it thanks to songs like Outside Today, 38 Baby, and Like A Jungle. NBA has 11 children with more than 7 women.</p><p>Ken has another brother, Davaughn Tate. Born in 2001 and <b>22&nbsp; </b>years old, he is also older than Ken. Davaughn has become famous for getting involved with the law in 2019 when he was 18 years old after he was accused of murder. Ken and Davaughn have the same father but different mothers.</p><p>There is also Jeffrey Tate, who, although has been referred to as Ken’s brother, is only Davaughn’s brother. Born in 2003, he has been in the music business since 2020 and is known for songs such as Sin Again and Trap Talk.</p><h2><strong>He Has Not Been Involved in Any Serious Controversies</strong></h2><p>The life of Gaulden has been one that is highlighted by so much violence and crime. However, he has managed to stay away from most of it. Unlike his older brother, NBA YoungBoy, who first got arrested when he was only 14 years old and came to be arrested more times for different offenses, including illegal possession of arms and an alleged first-degree <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>murder attempt</a>, Ken has never been on public records to have been arrested.</p><p>More so, his half-brother, Davaughn Tate, has also been in the bad books of the law. He was arrested in 2019 in connection to the shooting and killing of a 17-year-old. He was arrested with his brother, Jeffery Tate, who was also alleged to have taken part in the crime. Amidst all these, Ken has still found a way of not getting anything to do with the law, at least to public knowledge.</p><p>That said, he has been a victim of violence in the past. While the circumstance of this is not clear, he once revealed gunshot wounds on his Instagram. However, he did not reveal how he came by them. The young Gaulden is always seen on social media posing with dangerous weapons.</p><h2><strong>What Does NBA YoungBoy’s Brother Do for a Living?</strong></h2><p>The most important thing that highlighted the childhood of Ken, in spite of all the crime and violence that surrounded him, was music. Not only did he have both his older siblings involved in music, but his mother was also an aspiring rapper who was recognized as Ms. Sherhonda. His other brother, Jefferey, is also into music.</p><p>With all these, one would expect that Ken would also follow in the musical path of the family and do music for a living, but it is not so with him. Instead of music, he is a social media personality who has built a good following on Instagram, although he now seems to have lost his account, which had over a hundred thousand followers.</p><p>Apart from his social media activities, other things that the years old is into have not been made known. One thing that is clear, however, is that whatever he might be doing might not have anything to do with the public, which is why it is not known.</p><h2><strong>The Personal Life of Ken Gaulden Has Been Kept Away From The Public</strong></h2><p>Ken Gaulden’s older siblings already have partners and kids, with NBA alone having as many as 11 children. However, Ken has kept his life away from the public. It is clear that for now, he is still not yet married, but it is not known whether he has any kids or not.</p><p>Another thing that he has not revealed to the public is whether he is single or in a relationship at the moment. Because of how much of a private person he is, all about his love life are matters of mere speculation.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHtLvUrZ%2BanqKesKJ6wqikaK2jZMSpu4yiqmajlaN6qK3UpZuepl2Wua15wJumrqxdo6%2BiediorKefXZe8ur%2BMm6morJiav3A%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
