In November, he would have turned four.</p><p><span style=color:red><a style=color:red href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>Dee Brown </strong></a></span>confirmed Zeus’s death news through a Facebook post:</p><p>“To all of my friends, Zeus, the tallest dog in the world, passed over the rainbow bridge after contracting pneumonia following his amputation. For Brittany Davis and her entire family, kindly pray. Zeus was relatively famous, and he will be much missed. In our opinion, Zeus could not have had a better family to spend his life with.”<br></p><h2><strong>What Happened to Zeus?</strong></h2><p><span style=color:red><a style=color:red href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Brittany Davis</a></span> shared the heartbreaking news on August 27, 2023, that Zeus was given a <span style=color:red><a style=color:red href=# rel="nofollow noopener">cancer diagnosis</a></span> on his leg; he has a highly aggressive osteosarcoma. She wrote that we have several therapy choices but humbly ask for help.</p><p>Brittany also created a <span style=color:red><a style=color:red href=# rel="nofollow noopener">GoFundMe</a></span> campaign to fund Zeus Treatment and surgery. She later posted on <span style=color:red><a style=color:red href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Facebook</a> </span>that Zeus was going for surgery on September 8, 2023, and asked for prayers for everyone.</p><p>Unfortunately, Zeus’s condition was unstable; Brittany made another<span style=color:red><a style=color:red href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> statement</a> </span>last night that said they got a call from doctors this morning. Zeus had encountered several issues both yesterday night and this morning.</p><p>They observed that he was more lethargic and didn’t want to eat. Although his mild fever from last night had subsided, he was still lethargic. His mouth had some bluing as well. They took Zeus’ chest X-rays and blood tests.</p><p>She stated that doctors found that he had aspiration pneumonia, meaning his lungs were filled with fluid and bacteria. He was expected to stay in the hospital for at least a few more days. If the antibiotics are helping and he is feeling better.<br></p><p>Later, after the next morning, Zeus left the world by leaving her owners and loved ones in sadness and disbelief. Thoughts and Condolences to the owners’ Davis family and society.</p><h3><strong>About Zeus</strong></h3><p>Zeus was a unique dog. Zeus had also previously earned <span style=color:red><a style=color:red href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Guinness World Records</a></span> for the tallest dog in his name.</p><p>He was kind, loving, and quite headstrong, yet he was always delighted to run into his family and many friends while exploring Dallas and Fort Worth. Zeus was prepared to defeat cancer since he lived a full life in three short years.</p><p>He entered her life when he was eight weeks old and rapidly established himself as a significant and necessary member of the family. Due to his enormous size, Zeus attracted much attention when walking.</p><p>According to Brittany, people frequently enquired about riding Zeus like a horse. Of course, the response was negative. He was so tall that when he felt naughty, he would steal food from the counters and drink from the kitchen sink.</p><p>“Zeus always brought a smile to our faces because he was such a larger-than-life character and spread joy wherever he went,” said Craig Glenday, Editor-in-Chief of Guinness World Records. Zeus, rest in peace. You will always be a legend.</p><p>Source: <span style=color:red><a style=color:red href=#>uptospeedjournalism.com</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7trzTqKqpnZWZt7DB0aeYpaGjonuku8xopZ6vo2THpsHSZquhnV2prq24xKyrZpyfnHqltcSsZKieXZiur6%2FEq2Y%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
