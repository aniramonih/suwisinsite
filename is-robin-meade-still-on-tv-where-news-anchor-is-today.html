In her native Ohio, she began working at local news stations, building up her resume with impactful coverage. Robin won a regional Emmy Award after covering the 1995 Metra train collision in Fox River Grove, Illinois.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The news veteran joined HLN in 2001 as a correspondent, covering a number of major news events like presidential inaugurations, public celebrity memorials and wars. Her years of experience in the news industry made her the perfect lead on </span><i><span>Morning Express With Robin Meade </span></i><span>alongside </span><b>Bob Van Dillen</b><span>, </span><b>Jennifer Westhoven </b><span>and more popular cohosts.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Is-Robin-Meade-Still-on-TV-Where-News-Anchor-Is-Today-.jpg><p><span>The award-winning journalist celebrated her 20th anniversary on the show in September 2021 and was ecstatic about the milestone.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“I always joke, ‘I can’t believe I haven’t been fired yet!’” she told </span><i><span>The Atlanta Journal-Constitution</span></i><span> at the time. “But I’m very grateful. It is the most surreal experience when someone says, ‘I’ve been watching you since junior high,’ and they’re 30 now! I wouldn’t be here if it weren’t for the viewers.”</span></p><h2><b>Is Robin Meade Still on TV?&nbsp;</b></h2><p><span>In December 2022, it was officially announced that </span><i><span>Morning Express With Robin Meade </span></i><span>would end after 21 years on the network. The news came after it was revealed that HLN would no longer produce live broadcasts. Instead, the network announced plans to simulcast </span><i><span>CNN This Morning</span></i><span> with </span><b>Don Lemon</b><span>, </span><b>Poppy Harlow</b><span> and </span><b>Kaitlan Collins</b><span> in Robin’s timeslot. Fans of the series were devastated that Robin and her staff were leaving HLN.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“Doing this show, with you, has been the joy of my life and my biggest concern is for my colleagues that they land on their feet and I wish I can make this change less scary,” Robin said during her final episode, before telling the audience, “Thank you for letting us start your day all these years.”</span></p><p><span>So far, Robin has not announced what’s next for her career. She did share on Instagram that she cleaned out her office at HLN in January 2023 and left the building for the final time.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46iqmaqn5e2r3nMnpidnV2owaq4y2amp2Wkq3q4tMSrnGamlazAbq3NnJ%2Boql2ewG7Azp2Ysmc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
