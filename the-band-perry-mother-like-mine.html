It’s actually the only song in the album that they wrote without any outside writers.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Story Behind The Song&nbsp;</h2><p>The country trio, comprised of Kimberly, Reid, and Neil Perry siblings, is obviously a tight-knit group. And the woman who rules the roost is no other than their mother, Marie – who obviously inspired “Mother Like Mine.”</p><p>“That was the most honest song we wrote for Pioneer,” Kimberly Perry said about the song, which comes with sentimental lyrics that include anybody who believes that their mother makes the world a better place.</p><p><strong>RELATED:</strong> <a href=#>10 Country Songs About Mothers, The Most Especial Woman In Our Lives</a></p><p>It came to the trio while they were going through some song ideas, and then Neil shared to them a line he wrote on his phone. It said, “If the world had a mother like mine.”</p><p>This made the group think about what the world would be like if only it was raised like how their mother raised them. Perhaps the wars would all be over, and we’d all be walking on grass that’s greener, don’t you think?</p><p>“Our mother is our personal hero. We are her labor of love. It’s our honor to our mother on Pioneer,” Kimberly added.</p><p>Surely, Mama Perry is the real deal.
