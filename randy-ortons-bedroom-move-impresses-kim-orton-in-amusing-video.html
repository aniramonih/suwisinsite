His relationship with his wife Kim Orton remains a highlight for fans and it appears she made a hilarious post recently.</p><p>Orton was seen as a very problematic person backstage in WWE during his early days. ThebViper would eventually become a better person after meeting his wife Kim, and he even gave her some credit for that change.</p><p>Randy Orton has been out of action for over a year now due to his back injury. He was written off WWE television after being attacked by The Usos last year and fans continue to miss him.&nbsp;As previously reported,<a href=#>&nbsp;Orton underwent back fusion surgery</a>&nbsp;and it’s been a waiting game since then.</p><p>Recently an Instagram user posted a hilarious reel, noting that “98/100 women wish their man knew this bedroom move. This was followed by Randy Orton hitting the RKO on Nia Jax. Kim Orton shared the video calling herself and Nia Jax lucky.</p><p>Randy Orton considers himself a very lucky man to have someone like Kim as his wife and we can certainly understand why now. Ringside News exclusively reported that&nbsp;<a href=#>Randy Orton’s return to the squared circle is planned</a>, but it won’t happen this Summer.
