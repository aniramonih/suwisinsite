Initially, Charter One Airlines operated as a charter tour operator, offering travel packages to popular entertainment destinations such as Atlantic City, Las Vegas, and the Bahamas.</p><p>In 1992, Charter One Airlines embarked on a significant transformation.

The company’s strategic focus on providing affordable air travel attracted a growing number of passengers seeking budget-friendly options.</p><p>During this period, Spirit Airlines transitioned from being a charter tour operator to offering scheduled flights to various destinations. In June 1992, the airline launched its first scheduled flight between Detroit and Atlantic City, marking the beginning of its foray into the realm of commercial aviation.</p><p>This milestone allowed Spirit Airlines to introduce its services to a wider audience and capitalize on the demand for convenient and cost-effective air travel.
