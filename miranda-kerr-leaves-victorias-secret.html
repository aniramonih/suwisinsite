"I'm sure anyone that has worked with me would agree that's not true," the Australian beauty said this week as she confirmed that she is hanging up her Angel wings. Miranda, 29, told the that she had decided not to renew her contact with the lingerie giant in order to focus on her family and other commitments. "This is a natural evolution," said the brunette beauty, who has a son Flynn, two, with husband Orlando Bloom. "The thing is, I've been modeling since I was 13. I'm now entering a new phase in my life. I have felt this coming since my son was born and, after I became a mother, I realised I needed to prioritise my time."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a1d6cba322d9-2012-mir-z.jpg><p id=ebN1t8z34APY data-wc=135>Those priorities will include Miranda's Kora Organics skincare and beauty range. "I've reached a point in my career where I'm developing my own opportunities that are really reflective of my passions," she said. "I'm just not in a position to commit to a full contract at this time. It's three month at a bare minimum. "Miranda is also the face of Spanish retailer <strong>Mango</strong>, and plans to release , a follow-up to her best-selling book , later this year.Just because she has decided to separate from the <strong>Victoria's Secret</strong> brand doesn't mean Miranda won't have any involvement with the company. She has already accepted their invitation to walk in this year's big show, with <strong>Ed Razek</strong>, president of Victoria's Secret, saying in a statement that Miranda "will always be an Angel to me."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/3b7dd3fc0bf4-miranda-kerr-1-z.jpg><p id=exUZCtw49oOA data-wc=125>Last week he also slammed claims made in that the model had been let go because she is "not a big seller for VS" and "had a difficult reputation"."Miranda Kerr is one of the best models in the history of the business – and easily one of the most popular," he said. "She is also a consummate professional. Any rumours to the contrary are simply untrue. "While her international commitments have kept her away from us more than we'd like over the past few years, she will always be an Angel to me." He continued: "We have no plans to stop working with her. In fact, I've already invited her to walk the runway in this year's fashion show and, happily, she agreed."</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
