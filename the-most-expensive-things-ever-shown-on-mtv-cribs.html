The radio personality turned rapper had two major label records under his belt at that point, and he sure seemed to be doing well for himself. Now by "Cribs" standards, good old Luda's house didn't measure up to some of the castle-like structures that were seen in other episodes, but he showed one particular item that stood out: a Russian sable fur blanket.</p><p>"This right here is genuine German Shepherd," joked Ludacris, before telling viewers what the blanket is really made of. "[Russian sable fur] is more priceless than mink," he stated. However, the site Master Furrier gives a more specific number for such an item, which is $64,521, which was determined after converting British pounds to dollars. Of course, we'd have to consider every episode of "MTV Cribs" and do some figuring to be sure, but it's quite possible that Ludacris had the priciest blanket in the show's history.&nbsp;</p><p>After his episode aired, the rapper became even more successful since he appeared in movies like the "Fast & Furious" films and "Crash." Plus,&nbsp;<a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a> shows that Ludacris is worth $25 million so if he chose, he could buy enough Russian sable fur blankets to keep him warm for the rest of his days.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcG1kZX93e9OhnGaln6jBbrHXqZynq5mrsm7Ax6KloKtdmsOmvoysn6ivnmK8r3nMra1mm6Ker7R7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
