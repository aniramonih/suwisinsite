It’s now so cold outside, I don’t want to leave the comfort of my couch for, well, anything. But when I have to venture out into the world (sigh), I always reach for easy options — especially when temperatures are dropping.

This is why I constantly slip on my favorite <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Ugg Tasman X Waterproof Clogs</a> — which are available to shop right now at <a href=# rel=noopener>Nordstrom</a>! <a href=# rel=noopener>Clogs</a> are a bonafide staple shoe which can suit a variety of needs, which is precisely why I’m here to sing their praises!</p><p>The<a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="nofollow noopener">&nbsp;Ugg Tasman X Waterproof Clog</a> is a ruggedandyet cozy footwear option which keep your feet dry and secure — trust me! They boast Ugg’s Treadlite foam material for the uppers, which creates a durable and functional feel teamed with a removable Uggplush sock liner made with moisture-wicking textile composed of a wool-rich blend for ultimate support. These clogs also come in three color options to mesh with your tastes!</p><p><b>Get the </b><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><b>Ugg Tasman X Waterproof Clog</b></a><b> for $80 at Nordstrom!</b></p><p>Styling these versatile clogs is an easy feat, depending on your daily tasks. For example, they’re a solid option for healthcare workers due to the waterproof sock insert and chunky sole design. But if you’re not a valued essential worker, throwing these clogs on with your favorite pair of jeans, T-shirt and coat creates a neutral look which emphasizes relaxation!</p><p>Of course, Ugg has millions of fans across the world, but one Nordstrom reviewer <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">noted</a>, “These are my favorite shoes right now. [They’re] So comfortable and definitely look cool. Yes a little clunky, but like, in a cool way and insanely comfortable. I live where it snows and they’re great for most snow situations (not deep snow obviously). Super warm and easy on/off accessibility. [I] Probably would not wear without the sock insert as they’re too big that way, but [I] will most likely find a way to wear them for all seasons.”</p><p>Another happy Nordstrom customer <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">added</a>, “These are the best shoes ever!! I used to wear a different pair of shoes to work everyday to spice up my outfit, but now I only wear these. I am a nurse and on my feet 12 hours a day, these shoes are like fluffy supportive clouds.” One more reviewer <a href=#>chimed in</a>, “I am obsessed with these shoes-I wear them all the time without the sock insert and can walk comfortably pretty long distances. I immediately bought a pair for my stepmom too and she loves them.”</p><p>If you’re looking for a multifunctional, easy footwear option, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">these dreamy clogs</a> may be the perfect choice for you!</p><p><strong>See it: Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Ugg Tasman X Waterproof Clog</a> for $80 at Nordstrom!</strong></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><strong>Want a pair of cozy clogs but not feeling this option?
