The then-23-year-old Wisconsin man had a history of mental illness and a criminal record for indecent exposure when he and Gypsy met on the internet.</p><p>Therefore, Who is Nick Godejohn mother? This post contains spoilers for The Act Episode 7, “Bonnie & Clyde.” As Nick Godejohn’s mother, Kathy—the role she plays in the seventh episode of The Act—Juliette Lewis looks like a woman who’s had almost every ounce of life drained out of her. Her voice is mumbly and flat, as though each sentence is a sigh.</p><p>How did Gypsy get caught? When people saw the post, some of Dee Dee’s concerned neighbors alerted authorities, who then found her body on June 14, 2015. Law enforcement traced the Facebook message to Godejohn’s home the next day and arrested Gypsy and Godejohn in connection with the murder.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Why_is_Gypsys_voice_so_high></span><strong>Why is Gypsys voice so high?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>“It is possible that Gypsy Rose presents with puberphonia (high-pitched voice after birth), a class of psychogenic voice disorders,” says Jayne Latz, an executive communication coach and president and founder of Corporate Speech Solutions.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Gypsy_Rose_Still_Alive_2021></span><strong>Is Gypsy Rose Still Alive 2021?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Gypsy is still serving her sentence, and will definitely look different when she gets out than she did in photos from when she was a kid. She’ll be eligible for parole at the end of 2023.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Nick_Godejohn_alive></span><strong>Is Nick Godejohn alive?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Godejohn was sentenced in court in February 2019 for the 2015 murder of Dee Dee Blanchard. Godejohn was convicted of first-degree murder and armed criminal action in late 2018. He now will spend life in prison for the murder charge and 25 years for the armed criminal action charge.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Does_Nick_Godejohn_still_love_Gypsy></span><strong>Does Nick Godejohn still love Gypsy?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>“She was basically the mastermind behind it all. I was basically a hired hit man in its own weird sense,” Nick told ABC News in a video conference before his trial. “The reason why I did do this because I was for some so deeply in love with Gypsy at the time. I do still love her.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=When_did_Gypsy_get_out_of_jail></span><strong>When did Gypsy get out of jail?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Gypsy was convicted of second-degree murder in July 2016. She will be eligible for parole in 2024 and is currently serving a 10-year sentence for the slaying of her mother, Dee Dee, who is said to have suffered from Munchausen syndrome by proxy.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_does_Gypsy_Rose_Think_of_Nick></span><strong>What does Gypsy Rose Think of Nick?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>I learned all that the hard way,” she said. “Now, I don’t hate him. I feel sorry for him,” Gypsy said of Nick. “He was very much like my mother in certain ways, both of them were very controlling, and I feel like I was trained my whole life to do as I was told.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Why_did_Gypsy_only_get_10_years></span><strong>Why did Gypsy only get 10 years?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Prosecutors cut a deal with Gypsy, however, because of the horrific abuse she suffered at the hands of her mother. In exchange for pleading guilty to second-degree murder, Gypsy was sentenced to the minimum of 10 years in prison.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_found_Dee_Blanchards_body></span><strong>Who found Dee Blanchard’s body?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>“I couldn’t stand the thought of her just there because what happens if it would have taken months to find her, so I wanted her found so she could have a proper burial,” Gypsy told 20/20. After obtaining a warrant, police entered the Blanchards’ house and found Dee Dee’s body.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Did_Joey_King_change_her_voice_for_The_Act></span><strong>Did Joey King change her voice for The Act?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Particularly, they’ve been taken back by its unusual high pitch. Many think it’s actually King’s real voice, but it’s not. In fact, when they were casting for her role in The Act, King recalls “the voice” being a crucial part of getting into character.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Did_Gypsy_Rose_Blanchard_have_guinea_pigs></span><strong>Did Gypsy Rose Blanchard have guinea pigs?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Did Gypsy Rose have Guinea Pigs as Pets? Maybe, but it’s unlikely. In reality, the Blanchards had two cats at the time of Dee Dee’s murder. Don’t worry—they were rescued by the local humane society.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Nick_still_in_jail></span><strong>Is Nick still in jail?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Nicholas Godejohn, 31, who is serving a life sentence at the Potosi Correctional Center for the 2015 murder of Dee Dee Blanchard, is now asking a judge to set aside the criminal case that ended with his murder conviction. The often-bizarre case and its aftermath drew global media attention.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Will_Gypsy_Rose_be_released_early></span><strong>Will Gypsy Rose be released early?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Blanchard has now served more than half of her sentence for the 2015 murder of her mother, Dee Dee Blanchard, and she could be paroled as early as December 2023.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Did_Gypsy_Rose_know_her_age></span><strong>Did Gypsy Rose know her age?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In addition to being told she had leukemia, muscular dystrophy and epilepsy, Gypsy Rose Blanchard never even knew her real age. You’ll see in the trailer a fictionalized moment when her mother Dee Dee Blanchard (played by Patricia Arquette) is asked Gypsy’s age. “Oh, she’s 15, born in 1995,” Dee Dee says.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Where_is_Dee_Dee_Blanchard_now></span><strong>Where is Dee Dee Blanchard now?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Speaking with various media outlets, Blanchard says she was able to research Munchausen syndrome by proxy and said her mother had every symptom. She also says she feels freer in prison than she was before with her mother. Blanchard is now serving her sentence in Missouri’s Chillicothe Correctional Center.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Nick_from_The_Act_in_jail></span><strong>Is Nick from The Act in jail?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In the end, prosecutors in the case didn’t pursue the death penalty, and Godejohn was sentenced to life in prison in February 2019 at his trial, according to KOLR10 News.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Where_is_Nick_and_Gypsy_now></span><strong>Where is Nick and Gypsy now?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>He now will spend life in prison for the murder charge and 25 years for the armed criminal action charge. The two will run concurrently. He was given no chance at parole. Gypsy Blanchard, who was convicted of second-degree murder for her role in Dee Dee’s death, is currently serving ten years in prison.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_does_Nick_Godejohn_feel_about_Gypsy_now></span><strong>How does Nick Godejohn feel about Gypsy now?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In that same 20/20 interview, Nick admits to still feeling love for Gypsy. “I truly believed that she was, like, my soul mate,” he says. “There is a part of me that will probably always love her, but she’s hurt me so badly. I guess you could say my feelings got the best of me.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_much_money_did_Dee_Dee_Blanchard_receive></span><strong>How much money did Dee Dee Blanchard receive?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Dee Dee’s ex-husband and Gypsy’s father Rod Blanchard told Buzzfeed that he paid Dee Dee $1200 in child support every month even after Gypsy turned 18 because he believed she still needed full-time care. “There was never a question whether or not I was going to stop paying,” Rod said.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_does_Gypsy_Rose_feel_about_The_Act></span><strong>How does Gypsy Rose feel about The Act?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Gypsy Rose Blanchard Thinks ‘The Act’ Is Inaccurate, Won’t Meet Joey King, Spokesperson Says.
