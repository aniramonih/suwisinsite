Earlier this week, N.O.R.E announced in a teaser shared on @drinkchamps via Instagram that the “Super Gremlin” rapper will be on the popular show. Black can be heard discussing his relationship with Yung Miami, Drake, Kanye West and others. 
However, the “Roll In Peace” artists’ fans couldn’t seem to focus on their conversations as they were distracted by his “crazy” appearance."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Not sure what he is struggling with but something not right.”</p><p>Another commenter penned, “He high smh this not a good look I wish him the best tho hope he gets the help that he needs.” The concern surrounding Black’s appearance eventually found its way on X, where one fan suggested N.O.R.E refrain from releasing the full interview.&nbsp;</p><p>That person noted, “I don’t think drink champs should air that episode with Kodak , dude look crazy.” One other X user <a href=#>tweeted</a>, “Kodak Black look so bad.”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>I don’t think drink champs should air that episode with Kodak , dude look crazy</p>— Brian.
