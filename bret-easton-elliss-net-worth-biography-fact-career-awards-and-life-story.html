Born in Los Angeles, California, Bret Easton Ellis burst onto the literary scene in the late 80s, with the publication of his novel, “Less Than Zero”. The book chronicled the lives of a group of rich teenagers in Los Angeles. It sold well, and was subsequently made into a movie that actually had little to do with the book itself. His next novel, “The Rules of Attraction”, was a moderate success. However, it was his third novel, “American Psycho”, that made him a household name. He has since published four more novels. Most recently, he wrote the screenplay for the film, “The Canyons”, starring Lindsay Lohan and James Deen. Though the film has not yet been released, it has already achieved notoriety, as the production was hampered by Ms. Lohan’s unpredictable behavior. According to a January 2013 New York Times article, Bret Easton Ellis is allegedly facing financial troubles. The article suggested that Ellis is nearly out of money and has been forced to mortgage his condo. Hopefully he can churn out another awesome novel or screenplay quickly to get back on top!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3C8xKinpZ1fl7%2BmwIyemKysn6N6prjLoqqsZZ6awW7DzquroWWSnryovsCpn7JllpawtXnCmqmenaJirrit0Z2qZpmemXqttcWeZKysn6fGcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
