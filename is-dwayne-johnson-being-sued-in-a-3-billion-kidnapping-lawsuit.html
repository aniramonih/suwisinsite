Although she mostly goes by the last name Biggers, she is also known as Trenesha Sims and Trenesha Williams.</p><p data-characters=275 data-current-count=275 data-injectable=false>On Oct. 8, 2022, Biggers <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">filed a lawsuit</a> with the United States District Court, Southern District of New York accusing the defendants therein of conspiring “to kidnap Plaintiff [Biggers] and her two children from Brighter Tomorrows Domestic Violence Shelter.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=346 data-current-count=621 data-injectable=true>As it turns out, Biggers has a history of domestic violence. In 2009, she accused ex-boyfriend and former pro-wrestler Kurt Angle of domestic violence. The charges were <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">eventually dropped</a> during the case’s preliminary hearing. Prior to that, Biggers accused Angle of violating a protection order; but he was also <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">cleared of those charges</a>.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=326 data-current-count=326 data-injectable=false>In 2019, 10 years later, Biggers claimed that Angle aided and abetted the kidnapping allegations she’s put forth in her lawsuit with the United States District Court, Southern District of New York. As it turns out, Angle is just one of hundreds of people and entities named in the lawsuit, and yes, Johnson is one of them.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=275 data-current-count=601 data-injectable=true>Biggers also claims her ex-husband, Ephram Sims stalked and kidnapped her and her two children across state lines despite being on active probation for family violence. She asserts that law enforcement and all the named defendants, Johnson included, assisted in the effort.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-yes-dwayne-johnson-was-named-as-a-defendant-but-he-is-not-the-only-celebrity data-injectable=false>Yes, Dwayne Johnson was named as a defendant, but he is not the only celebrity</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Dwayne-The-Rock-Johnson-.jpg><p data-characters=345 data-current-count=645 data-injectable=true>Dwayne Johnson is indeed named as a defendant in Bigger’s $3 billion lawsuit, however, he was not referenced by name in the written account of Biggers’ overarching statement or timeline of events. Instead, he is listed as one of the many individuals and entities that law enforcement aided in terrorizing Biggers, or so she claims.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=258 data-current-count=258 data-injectable=false>In total, there are nearly 400 named defendants. Several of them are repeated throughout the document, often with a different spelling or completely capitalized instead of written in lowercase. A portion of the the hundreds of named defendants include:&nbsp;</p><ul data-items-injection=true data-current-count=838.5 data-injectable=true><li>Eminem</li><li>Michael Jordan</li><li>Booker T.

To top it off, Biggers listed the United States of America as a defendant. (Yes, she’s suing the country.) The U.S. was one of the entities Biggers named more than once, the second time around including a question mark — “USA?”</p><p data-characters=225 data-current-count=225 data-injectable=false>In 2019, right around the time Biggers claimed the whole world aided and abetted her kidnapping allegations, she was listed as one of El Paso’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">most wanted fugitives</a>. The charge? “Interference with child custody.”&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=362 data-current-count=587 data-injectable=true>Biggers claims in the kidnapping lawsuit that El Paso Times falsely accused her of being a wanted fugitive. In addition to a 73-point list of all the events that have happened between 2015 and 2016, she demanded “relief in the amount of $3 billion dollars.” Next to the date (Oct. 8, 2022), she signed her name, and next to that, she drew a tiny heart.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=190 data-current-count=190 data-injectable=false>As of June 2023, the case has (unsurprisingly) been dismissed by United States District Court Judge, Laura Taylor Swain. The order that dismissed the suit stated the following on the matter:</p><p>“The Court must dismiss an IFP complaint or portion thereof, that is frivolous or malicious, fails to state a claim on which relief may be granted, or seeks monetary relief from a defendant who is immune from such relief.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S2tHnDsJiyppVit7C0zaymp2WSmravs4ysrJ6cXZ67bq2MbGSboZyhtrC6jKSgnaaRpb2qusZmo5qvo6q2tXs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
