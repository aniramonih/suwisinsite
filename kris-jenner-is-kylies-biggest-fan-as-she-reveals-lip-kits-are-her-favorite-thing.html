Kris opened the press box in her video and instantly told us she was “in love.”</p><p>Before going on to discuss the three new colors released in the collection, Kris expressed that the products were her “favorite thing.”</p><p>Kris ended her promo for the lip kit by enthusiastically saying “I LOVE YOU KYLIE” followed by an announcement of the release date, which is August 25.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Kris Jenner (@krisjenner)</a></p></figure>View Instagram Post<h2 class=wp-block-heading id=the-kardashian-kids-think-kylie-is-their-moms-favorite>The Kardashian kids think Kylie is their mom’s favorite</h2><p>If you’re an avid Kardashian fan you will know that the family has always joked around that in the past, Kim was their mom’s “favorite.”</p><p>However, in recent years the sisters think the tables have turned and believe that Kylie is now their mom’s “favorite” child. During an interview with Andy Cohen on Watch What Happens Live, they were asked who their mother favors, to which Khloe immediately responded, “Kim 10 years ago.”</p><p>All three girls then chimed in saying “Kylie now.” Kourtney went on to back up the statement by saying, “and that’s facts, not just what we think.”</p><p>It is noteworthy that about 10 years ago, Kim was the financial centerpiece of the Kardashian family empire.
