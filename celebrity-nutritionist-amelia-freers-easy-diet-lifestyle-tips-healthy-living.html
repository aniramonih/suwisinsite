But some of them are very outspoken. Thankfully, the popular nutritional therapist, <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Amelia Freer</a> is not among the people who don’t share the secrets. The lady recently shared many easy diet and lifestyle tips with her fans and the best part is all the tips are easily applicable. Do try them and get to know yourself.</p><h3><strong>Why She Became a Nutritionist?</strong></h3><p>While talking to <a href=# rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>Telegraph</a>, the popular woman recently revealed that she had really bad diet habits when she was young and it reflected badly on her skin. She often felt exhausted and <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>bloating</a> was not uncommon with her. Her flatmate suggested her to see a nutritionist and one of those sessions inspired her to be a nutritionist too. She also became a nutritionist because she wanted to help people how to stock the fridge or cook in a&nbsp;proper manner. She even left a well paying job for a&nbsp;new career in her late twenties which was not an easy thing.</p><figure id=attachment_45524 aria-describedby=caption-attachment-45524 style=width:567px class="wp-caption aligncenter">Eat. Nourish. Glow. by Amelia Freer</figure><h3><strong>Diet Tips</strong></h3><p>The author of <a href=# rel=nofollow data-wpel-link=internal>COOK. NOURIS</a><a href=# rel=nofollow data-wpel-link=internal>H. GLOW.</a> (December 2015) has given some really useful diet tips for the people who want to be healthy by adopting healthy foods. Here they are:</p><h3><strong>Munch on Herbs</strong></h3><p>The first tip is that you should keep a big herb display on your kitchen counter. It will help you ward off your hunger as you can easily tear off the pieces while cooking or before eating and stay healthy. It will keep you away from munching on unhealthy foods like chocolate bars.</p><figure id=attachment_45523 aria-describedby=caption-attachment-45523 style=width:569px class="wp-caption aligncenter">Amelia Freer in her kitchen</figure><h3><strong>Right Way to Eat</strong></h3><p>Your next step should be to make sure that you enjoy your food nicely. Eat it slowly rather than “on the go.” Eat only when you feel hungry. Appreciate all the flavors and never eat when you are sad or bored.</p><h3><strong>3 Meal Rule</strong></h3><p>You should only eat 3 hearty meals in a day and let go off your habit of snacking. Your body does not require any snacks and you will stop craving them after you have 3 healthy and filling meals. Snacking unnecessarily makes your insulin levels high and the fat storage is also elevated. So, avoid munching at all.</p><h3><strong>Fluid Intake</strong></h3><p>Drinking plenty of <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>water</a> is a no fail strategy. But if you want you can drink one tea or coffee daily and some wine on special occasions. You also need to stop drinking sugar based drinks as they do no good to your body. Lattes and chocolate bars can be enjoyed occasionally, but say no to fizzy and sweetened drinks. (In short, control your sweet tooth!)</p><h3><strong>No Sugar or Processed Foods</strong></h3><p>You should never be dependent on sugar and processed grains like cereal, pasta and toast as they play a key role in making you a victim of poor health.</p><h3><strong>Lifestyle Tips</strong></h3><p>Amelia also shared some simple kitchen and lifestyle tips for healthy eating which we have listed over here.</p><h3><strong>Make Foods Creative</strong></h3><p>Most people don’t enjoy healthy foods (like oats or fresh veggies and fruits) because they look boring. You can rectify the situation by adding creativity to your meal preparation. Use herbs and spices to make your meals colorful and that way you will enjoy them more.</p><h3><strong>Enjoy Foods Properly</strong></h3><p>Eating with friends or family would help you enjoy your foods a bit more. You should also enjoy the process of making them. Don’t eat just for form’s sake and never make eating a joyless experience.</p><h3><strong>Keep the Knives Sharp</strong></h3><p>If you want your cooking process to go smoother, opt for sharp knives rather than blunt ones. Easy to cut foods will make your cooking more enjoyable and you’ll enjoy the meal in a better manner too.</p><h3><strong>Care for Nuts and Seeds</strong></h3><p>If you want to make sure that your nuts and seeds retain their fatty acids, then you should keep them in the fridge at all times.</p><figure id=attachment_45522 aria-describedby=caption-attachment-45522 style=width:469px class="wp-caption aligncenter">Amelia Freer exercising</figure><h3><strong>Small Changes</strong></h3><p>If you wish to change your diet habits, go for small changes first. Try adopting changes like one teaspoon of sugar rather than two, then you can switch to no sugar option. It will make things easier for you. An overnight change like quitting <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>sugar</a> from a single day doesn’t stick for long. (And we agree!!)</p><h3><strong>Don’t expect perfection</strong></h3><p>It’s okay to fail a bit in your diet journey. If you indulge in some bad food every now and then, don’t beat yourself over it. Accept your mistake and strengthen your resolve to not repeat it in the future.</p><h3><strong>Feel Good</strong></h3><p>Learn how to eat the right foods in a manner that you not only look good but feel good from the inside. If you are too busy, you may not need to prepare a perfect three course meal every day. Just opt for quick-to-make healthy meals, but make sure you create them from scratch and enjoy making them.</p><h3><strong>Frozen Herbs Magic</strong></h3><p>If you are too busy in the mornings, then this simple tip can help you a lot. Just cut some herbs like oregano, rosemary or sage and put them into an ice cube tray with olive oil or coconut oil. Then let them freeze overnight and keep the cubes labeled for daily use. You can use them in stews, soups and roasts within a few seconds. (Useful tip, we must say)</p><h3><strong>Let Your Tastes Develop</strong></h3><p>If you have been addicted to processed or junk foods most of your life, then you have certainly developed a taste for it. Break this bad habit by exploring different flavors of healthy as well as exciting foods available in the market. Once you do that, you will start preferring natural foods over processed ones and your taste buds would be delighted too.</p><h3><strong>You have all the Power</strong></h3><p>Freer concluded by repeating a wise advice shared by American holistic health expert and author, Ann Wigmore. The advice is that food can be a safe and powerful form of medicine that keeps you healthy or it can be a slow poison that empties your health from the inside. It’s always your choice which option you opt for.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZa5tbTYnJylnZJjsLC5jpycpZ2Sp7a1xYynrK2qmam2sLrIrKtmmZ2auaqtjJ%2Bpnp2iqHqmrdKyZJ2hlal6rbXFnqqtsZyaerW1z6xkoZ2RocGpxYyloK%2Bhnpx8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
