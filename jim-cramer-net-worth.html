Even though he became a member of the New York State Bar in 1985, he never practiced law, and his license was suspended in 2009 for not renewing it.</p><p>Starting in 1987, Cramer left Goldman Sachs to create his hedge fund, Cramer & Co. (later known as Cramer, Berkowitz & Co.). He attracted $450 million in funding and earned a 20% fee from the profits.</p><p>Early investors included Steve Brill, Eliot Spitzer, and Martin Peretz. He retired from managing the hedge fund in 2001, and his partner Jeff Berkowitz took over. Cramer claimed positive returns almost every year, but some dispute his results.</p><p>Cramer also worked on SmartMoney magazine and faced criticism for making a $2 million personal gain by buying stocks before an article with his recommendations was published.</p><p>In 1996, he and Martin Peretz started the financial news website TheStreet.com, which was later sold in 2019 to TheMaven for $16.5 million. During the late 1990s, Cramer became a frequent guest on CNBC.</p><p>He co-hosted “Kudlow & Cramer” from 2002 to 2005 and then started his show, “Mad Money with Jim Cramer,” in 2005 on CNBC. The show aims to empower viewers with tools and knowledge for better investing.</p><p>Cramer must disclose the stock positions he discusses on the show and is restricted from trading those stocks for five days after each broadcast. The inspiration for “Mad Money” came from Cramer’s earlier one-hour radio show, “Jim Cramer’s Real Money,” which ended in December 2006.</p><h2>What Are Some of the Books Authored by Cramer?</h2><p>Cramer has authored and released multiple books, such as “Confessions of a Street Addict” (2002), “You Got Screwed!
