Recommended Videos Chainsaw Man definitely falls within the shonen category, following the reliable guide map that’s made other titles like Naruto and Demon Slayer so popular; our protagonist has something about him that makes him extraordinary in his universe (in Denji’s case, the powers of the Chainsaw Devil), he is associated with a special organization that can help him achieve his goals, he makes close companions throughout his journey, etc."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Denji, unlike protagonists like Naruto and Tanjiro, doesn’t have a noble goal like saving the world or becoming the strongest; his goals are simple. He really just wants to have sex with a pretty girl (queue the many Chainsaw Man Readers <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">commenting on the Viz website</a>, “he’s just like me for real!”) and live a comfortable life. Denji’s simple-mindedness makes a lot of sense when you realize just how young the main character of Chainsaw Man really is.</p><h2 id=h-denji-s-age-in-chainsaw-man-explained data-injectable=false>Denji’s age in Chainsaw Man, explained</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Chainsaw-Man.jpg><p data-characters=368 data-current-count=668 data-injectable=true>During the Public Safety saga, Denji reveals he’s 16 years old. Once Denji is recruited as one of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Public Safety’s devil hunters</a>, he goes out to a restaurant that serves alcohol with his coworkers. While most of his coworkers have drinks with their food, Denji lets them know he’s too young to drink, shocking some of his companions with how young he actually is.</p><p data-characters=563 data-current-count=563 data-injectable=true>In some ways, Denji gives off an air of being an adult because of how self-reliant he became during his rough upbringing but in other ways (read: how horny he is), he really is just a teenager. There’s some debate over his age because he mentions that he “thinks” he’s 16, but there’s no reason to believe he’s not that age; if anything, the way he talks about age just emphasizes how hard his life with Pochita was. Denji was too busy trying to pay off his father’s debt and stay alive to even go to school, let alone pay attention to his birthday.</p><p data-characters=430 data-current-count=430 data-injectable=false>While the anime has only <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">adapted the first four arcs of the Public Safety Saga</a>, Denji has aged slightly in the manga. It acknowledges Denji’s birthday toward the end of the Public Safety Saga, so he is now 17 years old as of the Academy Saga. His 17th birthday was, uh, not the best (Power fans will agree it can’t get much worse) so hopefully his 18th fares better. After all, Pochita knows that he deserves a break for once.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeRo7ausY6hprBln6GxbrXSZpueppqeeqe%2BzqZknKCRnru0rdZmpJqmXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
