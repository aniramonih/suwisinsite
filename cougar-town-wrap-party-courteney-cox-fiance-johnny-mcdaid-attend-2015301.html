Cougar Town’s sixth and final season is coming to a close, and to celebrate, <a href=#><strong>Courteney Cox</strong></a> and the rest of the cast reminisced about Gulfhaven, Fla., at a wrap party at West Hollywood’s Rivabella on Saturday, Jan. 24.</p><p>An insider tells <a href=#><strong>Us Weekly</strong></a> that the costars drank up and mingled at the shindig, which was sponsored by Kettle One vodka. Guests in attendance included Cox and her costars<strong> Josh Hopkins</strong>, <a href=#><strong>Busy Philipps</strong></a>, <strong>Christa Miller</strong>, <strong>Carolyn Hennesy</strong> (aka Barb), and <strong>Ian Gomez</strong> and his wife <strong>Nia Vardalos</strong>. Scrubs alum <strong><a href=#>Zach Braff</a> </strong>and <strong>Sarah Chalke</strong> — Scrubs and Cougar Town share many of the same producers and writers — also made an appearance.</p><p>The night proved to be a special one for star Cox, who was accompanied by fiance <strong>Johnny McDaid</strong>. Her ex-husband <strong><a href=#>David Arquette</a> </strong>and his fiancee<strong> Christina McLarty</strong> joined in on the fun, too.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>Cox and the Snow Patrol rocker — who got engaged in June 2014 — arrived holding hands, the onlooker tells <strong>Us</strong>. Coordinating in black leather jackets and black boots, they stayed close for most of the night. Some of the party’s highlights included an outside patio filled with collages of the cast and crew, and a video of blooper outtakes.</p><p>“Courteney was smiling while proudly pointing at different photos as Johnny stayed close to her side,” the insider tells <strong>Us</strong>. “The photos seemed to bring back pleasant memories.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>The gang created new memories, too. Cox’s current and former loves bonded during the bash. “[Johnny and David] were talking nonstop and seemed to be having great conversation. They seem like genuine friends and looked like they were pleased to be catching up,” the insider says. “The guys looked totally at ease together and seemed like great buddies.” Arquette also caught up with Cox. The source adds: “You can tell they have a solid friendship.” (The couple split in October 2010 after 11 years of marriage and share daughter <strong>Coco</strong>, 10.)</p><p>Philipps, meanwhile, snuck in some time with Cox as the night went on. The ladies took photos with the crew members in the courtyard. “Busy was a social butterfly and looked like she was really enjoying her time,” the source adds.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>In between rehashing great memories, guests feasted on dishes like tempura shrimp skewers, mushroom and salmon flatbread pizzas, truffle asparagus quiche, black truffle ravioli bites, meatball sliders, and chicken Parmesan sliders. Sweet treats for dessert included mini blueberry pie and coffee mousse.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Cougar Town premiered on ABC in September 2009 (moving to TBS in 2012), and as fans know, the characters have probably gone through hundreds of wine bottles by now. Luckily, some other special themed Ketel One vodka cocktails were an option at the wrap party. Cox and the rest of the cast sipped on “The Cougar Martini,” “The Ketel One Citreon Fizz,” with lemon juice and a splash of club soda, and “The Ketel One Oranje Cosmo,” a concoction of pomegranate juice, lemon sour, and served with orange slices.</p><p>Tell <strong>Us</strong>: Will you miss Cougar Town?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaJqorZeWv27AzrClZq%2Bilr1uvMCrq7Jlk6TCs8DEp5yyZZOkxW6yyJqlnJ1dn7ypus2yZKablJa2pXnAraueppRif3F9lGxnag%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
