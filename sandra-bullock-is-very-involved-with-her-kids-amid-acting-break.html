But he is an example even when I don’t agree with him. … We’re saying it differently, but we mean the exact same thing.”</p><p>Despite their ups and downs, the <a href=#>Blind Side</a> star went on to call their family dynamic “the best thing ever,” adding, “I don’t need a paper to be a devoted partner, a devoted mother. I don’t need to be told to be ever present. I don’t need to be told to weather the storm with a good man.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>When it comes to her parenting style, Bullock revealed to <a href=#>Extra</a> in December 2021 that she often <a href=#>takes on the role of “bad cop.”</a> She continued: “I let Bry be the treat guy.
