The iconic figure behind WWE, one who has lived a very controversial life, will not get any say in the final editing of the project.</p><p>The highly-anticipated docuseries about his life and career is set to premiere on Netflix at an undisclosed date. The revelation about how the final viewing will come together comes from Bill Simmons, the executive producer. He confirmed that McMahon will not have the ultimate say or authority to alter the content, despite his central role in the narrative.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Simmons, speaking at the Bloomberg Screentime event, shared his excitement about the project, describing it as the most promising endeavor he has ever been involved in. He highlighted the uniqueness of the series, emphasizing its adherence to an "old school" approach reminiscent of the acclaimed 30 for 30 documentaries. Simmons affirmed that Netflix will maintain the final cut authority, making it a distinctive venture in the world of sports documentaries.</p><p>This is good news for fans who want "the real" story and not one influenced by McMahon.
