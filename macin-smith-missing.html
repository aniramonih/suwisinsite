Macin’s parents, Darrin and Tracey, thought that Macin was leaving for school.&nbsp;</p><p>However, when it was confirmed by the school that he didn’t come that day. It was reported that he was 17 years old at the time he went missing.&nbsp;</p><p>In the investigation, it was found that Macin left his wallet, cell phone, and computer at his home. He didn’t take anything with him, and this indicated that the teen might harm himself as he was reported to be under depression.&nbsp;</p><p>Since 2015, it has been more than seven years, and the teen is still missing.

The group has more than 50,000 members, and they were all encouraged that if anyone had any leads or information about Macin, then they could address it on the group.&nbsp;</p><p>When the group was searched, it was found that the name of the group was “<strong>#MacinsArmy</strong>.” There were rumors that people had sighted Macin in different parts of the country.&nbsp;</p><p>When the officials ran an investigation into those areas, they found that all the claims related to Macin’s sighting were false.&nbsp;</p><p>In these seven years, Macin’s family and his loved ones have not lost hope, and they are still confident that they will find their son soon.&nbsp;</p><p>Macin’s mother shared a statement in which she said, “I think it’s very important that my son is not forgotten because he’s still out there, somewhere.”</p><p>She added, “Please keep your eyes open, whether you’re a hiker or a four-wheeler or somebody that’s just outdoors in the wilderness. He’s still out there.
