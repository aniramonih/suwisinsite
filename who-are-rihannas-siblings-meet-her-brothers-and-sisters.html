Her bond with her siblings is strong, and she values their relationship greatly. Given her worldwide fame, it is not surprising that her family members have become well-known figures too. This is largely because Rihanna’s fame has brought a lot of attention to her family.</p><h2><strong>How Many Siblings Does Rihanna Have?</strong></h2><p>Rihanna has five siblings. She has two brothers, Rorrey Fenty and Rajad Fenty, from the same parents, and they grew up together. For the record, Rihanna was born on February 20, 1988, in Saint Michael, Barbados, as the eldest of three children born to her parents, Ronald Fenty and Monica Braithwaite.</p><p>Unfortunately, her parent’s marriage did not endure, and they eventually got divorced without reconciling. Despite this, Rihanna was raised in Barbados along with her two brothers, Rorrey and Rajad Fenty, and developed strong bonds with them both. She often mentions her brothers in interviews and shows her love and support for them through various social media posts.</p><p>In addition to her two full brothers, Rihanna also has three half-siblings – two half-sisters, Kandy and Samantha, and one half-brother, Jamie. Reports suggest that she also has a close relationship with her half-siblings and often meets with them. This highlights her love and affection for her family members, regardless of their shared bloodlines.</p><p>It is on record that at the age of 16, Rihanna boldly relocated to the United States to pursue her dream of becoming a musician. Her talent, hard work, and dedication paid off, and she has since become one of the most successful and recognizable figures in the entertainment industry. Despite her busy schedule, she has maintained close ties with her family, particularly her two younger full brothers, Rorrey and Rajad.</p><p>The three siblings are known to be very close, and they often spend quality time together, reminding us that despite her fame and success, Rihanna remains down-to-earth and grounded.</p><h2><strong>Meet Rihanna’s Brothers</strong></h2><h3><strong>Rorrey Fenty</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Date of birth:</strong> November 13, 1989</li><li><strong>Age:</strong> 34 years old</li><li><strong>Occupation:</strong> Rapper</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/02/rorrey.jpg><p>Rihanna’s brother, Rorrey Fenty, was born on November 13, 1989, making him 34 at the moment.

He was born to Ronald Fenty and Monica Braithwaite on April 15, 1996, and is now 27 years old. He was raised in the beautiful Caribbean country of Barbados.</p><p>Rajad has lived a life somewhat shrouded in mystery. Unlike his brother and sister, who have both gone into music, he has decided to stay off the enticements of the entertainment industry. While much is known about Rihanna and her musical journey, there is limited information available about Rajad and what he does for a living. But, despite keeping a low profile, he has still managed to gain a substantial following on social media, particularly on Instagram, where he boasts over 150,000 fans. This is mainly because of his famous sister’s influence.</p><p>Most of what is known about Rajad Fenty today is linked to his connection with Rihanna. Of course, being the younger brother of one of the biggest names in the music industry has its perks. At an early age, Rajad was able to experience the excitement of the entertainment world firsthand. He visited the sets of his sister’s music videos and shows, got to meet many famous individuals, including Jay-Z, and gained exposure to the industry in a way that most people can only dream of.</p><p>Rajad’s ties to the world of entertainment and fashion were further solidified when he attended Paris Fashion Week in 2017, a highly-anticipated event in the fashion world that showcases the latest collections from top designers. His attendance at this high-profile event is evidence of his connections within the industry, mainly because of his sister’s influence.</p><p>Additionally, by attending events and parties with his older sister, Rihanna, Rajad has had the opportunity to interact with and meet many famous people, including Sam Smith and Cara Delevingne. Despite his lower profile, it is clear that Rajad is an important member of his family and has close relationships with those closest to him.</p><h2><strong>Meet Rihanna’s Three Half-Siblings&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Rorrey and Rajad are Rihanna’s full-blooded siblings. However, her family tree also includes two half-sisters, Kandy Fenty and Samantha Fenty, and one half-brother, Jamie Fenty. These half-siblings were born from her father’s previous relationships before his marriage to her mother and the birth of Rorrey, Rajad, and Rihanna.</p><p>Although Kandy, Samantha, and Jamie may not have gained the same level of notoriety as their famous sibling, they are still a crucial part of Rihanna’s family and close to her. It is important to recognize and acknowledge the existence of these half-siblings and the bond they share with Rihanna. Let’s take a look at their lives.</p><h3><strong>Kandy Fenty</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Date of birth:</strong> 1971</li><li><strong>Occupation:</strong> Pharmacist’s assistant</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/02/Rihanna-sama.jpg><p>Kandy Fenty is Rihanna’s oldest half-sibling. According to reports, Kandy was born in the year 1971 in Barbados. Although the exact date of her birth, including the month and day, remains unknown, it is known that she was raised in Barbados by her grandparents. This is because Kandy’s mother left Barbados for the United Kingdom, and as a child, Kandy did not know who her father was.</p><p>Years later, when Kandy was older, she went on a trip to visit her mother in Dagenham, east London. It was during this trip that her mother revealed the identity of Kandy’s father to her. Upon discovering the identity of her father, Kandy made the decision to meet him. She located where he lived and introduced herself as his daughter when he opened the door.</p><p>To Kandy’s surprise, her father, Ronald Fenty, was shocked to see her because he did not know of her existence. However, upon asking about her mother, Ronald realized that Kandy was indeed his daughter. Ronald later admitted that in his younger days, he had many relationships with women and was on the wild side, leading him to believe that there might be children out there that he was unaware of.</p><p>After their initial meeting, Ronald welcomed Kandy into the family, and they have been close ever since. Kandy has also become close to all her other siblings. According to our findings, Rihanna was around 15 years old at the time of their meeting. Ever since then, they have remained close and keep in touch very often.</p><p>Reports show that Kandy now works as a pharmacist’s assistant in Barbados and is reportedly married, although the identity of her husband is not known. She also has two daughters who are called Brandy and Crystal, who are fans of their famous aunt, Rihanna. Kandy has stated that even before Rihanna’s rise to fame, her children were already fond of her because she was so cool.</p><p>Rihanna, in turn, is also very fond of her nieces and enjoys spending time with them. She makes sure she meets with them from to time.

Friends and family have described the two as almost inseparable in their youth. Samantha used to dress Rihanna up and style her hair, referring to her as her “mini me.” Despite the distance created by Rihanna’s move to the United States to pursue her music career, the two have remained close to this day.</p><p>Samantha has had a successful career in her own right. According to reports, she is now working as a policy consultant for Caribbean regional governments.
