Prior to his birth which was announced on social media, Ifeanyi became one of the most anticipated celebrity babies in Nigeria. He is the 3rd of Davido’s 3 children.</span></p><p>About 20 days after Davido’s son was born, his singer father who is one of the <a href=# rel=noopener data-wpel-link=internal>most celebrated musicians in Africa</a> organized the child’s christening in the UK on November 9, 2019.</p><p>At present, the 4-year-old David Jr. draws his fame from his parents. When he was a year old, Davido used his image alongside the One Milli singer for the cover of his 3rd studio album “A Better Time”.</p><h3><strong>David Adedeji Adeleke Jr.’s Parents Dated For About 6 Years Before Splitting</strong></h3><p>Before the birth of Davido’s first son Ifeanyi, his parents Imo State native Chioma and Davido had met while they were attending Babcock University in Osun State. They had met <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>through Davido’s friend</a> who was also dating Chioma’s friend.</p><p>After a while, they started dating in 2015, per HITC. Nonetheless, the rumor of their relationship started around late 2017 and was confirmed in 2018. In the course of the relationship, the 7th Days Adventist-born Chef Chi dropped out of Babcock University to focus on other things, including her affair with Davido.</p><p>David Adedeji Adeleke Jr.’s mother is not the only one to have dropped out of school. His father Davido also dropped out of Oakwood University, Alabama, in the US to pursue a career in music.</p><p>The relationship between Ifeanyi’s parents became one of the most publicized celebrity relationships ever in Nigeria. Chefchi, a model, social media influencer, and brand ambassador became the subject of Davido’s Assurance. The hit song also made its way to the film, Coming to America 2 (2021) where Adeleke Jr.’s father performed.</p><h3><strong>Davido and Chioma Were Engaged For More Than a Year</strong></h3><p>The<span data-preserver-spaces=true> 28-year-old Chioma became engaged to Davido in September 2019 when she was 24 years old and the singer was 27. The engagement ring used by the Assurance singer to propose to Chioma is reportedly a customized one with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>“Assurance” Engraved</a> on it.&nbsp;</span></p><p>The diamond engagement ring which is believed to be worth nothing less than ₦3.6 million was handed to David Adedeji Adeleke Jr.’s mother by his father shortly before the celebrity child was born and a few days after his parents had formal introductions with their families.</p><p>The engagement started to raise questions when there was no news of the wedding whatsoever even though Ifeanyi’s father had prompted his fans to start getting their “aseobi” ready. There were further suggestions that the engagement may have crashed in 2020 as Chioma was spotted with the expensive diamond ring.</p><p>Still, Davido claimed that there was going to be a wedding. It was reportedly slated for 2020 but was slowed down by the COVID-19 pandemic. While people were still waiting for a probable wedding, rumors started rallying around that the relationship of the then-power couple was suffering due to domestic violence.</p><p>According to unconfirmed reports, the celebrity couple and parents of Adeleke Jr. were involved in a physical confrontation that left Chioma with a broken leg. Well, there were denials from Ifeanyi’s mother about violence in her supposed-marital home.</p><p>Davido’s son was 1 when issues surrounding his parent’s relationship started to jump from one web page to another. Their engagement was also a year old but getting to 2 years, it was called off.</p><h3><strong>Davido’s Son Has Watched The Relationship of His Parents Crash</strong></h3><p>Maybe not literally, but David Adedeji Adeleke Jr. has seen the end of his parents’ relationship that once became a couple’s goal to many in Nigeria. The rumor of the end of their relationship started at about the time that Adeleke Jr. was a year old in 2020 when Chioma had shown herself to the public without the diamond customized ring.</p><p>Prior to that, the former couple reportedly unfollowed each other on Instagram before following each other again. Although Chioma and Davido have not outrightly mentioned that their relationship may have reached the end of the road, they have insinuated so in many ways.</p><p>The public drew the conclusion that Davido’s son may not see his parents get married when a picture of the older Adeleke kissing an American model Mya Yafai went viral on Instagram and somehow fell on the doorsteps of his fiancee Chioma.</p><p>At the time of writing this piece, David Adedeji Adeleke Jr., Davido’s son is in the custody of his chef and business owner mother but his father remains one of the most important figures in his life. Davido often shows off his first son on social media and also set aside his differences with Chioma to celebrate their only child’s second birthday in 2020. The move would lead to rumors that perhaps they were back together.</p><p>Just when the public was about to conclude that Ifeanyi’s parents may have a cordial relationship, the celebrities unfollowed each other on Instagram towards the end of March 2022. It also came after they had partied in London following Davido’s successful concert.</p><h2><strong>David Adedeji Adeleke Jr. Has 2 Older Sisters</strong></h2><p>He might be the only son of the Nigerian music star at the moment and the only child of his parents but David Adeleke Jr. is not the only child born to Davido. Meet his half-siblings.</p><h3><strong>The Oldest Sister of Davido’s Son is a Brand Ambassador and Child Model</strong></h3><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>8</span>-year-old Imade Aurora Adeleke was born on May 14, 2015, as the first child of Davido with his first baby mama entrepreneur and brand ambassador, Sophia Momodu. She was named after her paternal grandmother, Davido’s mother Veronica Imade Adeleke who died in 2003.</p><p>She is about 4 years older than Ifeanyi and was born the same year his parents started dating. Even though Imade’s fame is a result of being a celebrity kid, she has also been making a name for herself as a child model and brand ambassador. She is the face of Eva Baby Soap.</p><h3><strong>Hailey Veronica Adeleke is The Immediate Older Sister of David Adedeji Adeleke Jr.</strong></h3><p>Hailey also has the name of Davido’s mother, Veronica. She is the second of Davido’s children and was born on May 9th, 2017, to the singer and Amanda “Mandy”.</p><p>The <span data-preserver-spaces=true>6-year-old is about 2 years younger than Ifeanyi and she was born at the time when Chioma and Davido were believed to have been about 2 years into their relationship.</span></p><p>Like her older sister, Hailey serves as an Instagram model who has recorded thousands of followers. Regardless, her parents have left a large part of her life concealed, even though she is reported to be residing in the United States with her mother.</p><h3><strong>David Adeleke Jr. May Have Another Sibling</strong></h3><p>Prior to the birth of Imade in 2013, there were allegations that the OBO was expecting a child with a lady named Ayotomide Labinjo. She later gave birth to a daughter, Michelle Anuoluwapo.</p><p>Nonetheless, the alleged sibling of Davido’s son was said to have been denied by the 30 billion gang leader. To point out that he had nothing to do with the child, a DNA test was carried out and according to reports, it came out negative. This did not go down well with Labinjo who claimed that Davido had paid the doctor to alter the DNA result.</p><p>In addition, the alleged baby mama later went for legal action against Davido. Yet, the singer would also claim to have settled her out of pity.</p><h2><strong>How Many Followers Does Davido’s Son Have On Instagram?</strong></h2><p>Even though there are pictures of 4-year-old Ifeanyi plastered on the internet, he does not have an Instagram account at the time of this writing.</p><p>The celebrity child nonetheless has older sisters, Imade and Hailey who have pulled over 450,000 and more than 16 thousand followers respectively as of April 2022.</p><p>In the same vein, his singer and songwriter father and one of the <a href=# rel=noopener data-wpel-link=internal>richest musicians in Africa</a>, Davido has more than 23 million followers on Instagram and still counting. His mother Chefchi has claimed about 3 million followers on the platform and may as well still be counting.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHr7XGnqmimV6YvK571qGmZqGjYrGiwsidpqxlo6S7brDAr6CdZZGZsqWxyaJkmpyVobKssYyjqWg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
