She was also cast as Tina Moore in the ITV drama about 1966 England World Cup hero Bobby Moore and his wife Tina. Television career aside, Michelle has signed various lucrative contracts. She has modelled for Revlon makeup and high street fashion label Lipsy, which is said to pay around £250,000 a year alone. Her Garnier's Ambre Solaire self-tan range is reported to have earned her £150,000. In 2017, it was revealed that Michelle has teamed up with fashion brand Very - as well as having her own clothing line, she also has an exclusive homeware collection with the online retailer.</p><p id=eBdMdejGVDYB data-wc=1><strong>BEAUTY: </strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Inside Michelle Keegan's wedding makeup bag</a></p><p id=eaWr5YhCG1SG data-wc=150>The former Coronation Street star and her husband have each spent extended periods of time away from home since they moved in 2014; while Michelle travelled for months filming her role in the BBC drama , Mark was based in Los Angeles, where he worked as a presenter for US entertainment show Extra. In April, the actress revealed that she signed the contract for the fourth season of Our Girl. BBC One's Instagram account showed Michelle holding the script for the fourth series. The post was captioned: "Georgie's back! We're so excited for new #OurGirl with @MichKeegan!" The new series will consist of six episodes, with Michelle Keegan continuing her role as Lance Corporal Georgia Lane. The series will take place one year after the tour in Bangladesh, which ended with the team jumping from a cliff while hoping to reach safety, with their fates from their fall left unknown.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/14ea664522fa-michelle-keegan-coronation-street-2014-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=ea7GaDVGnk0H data-wc=8><strong>The star first found fame in Coronation Street</strong></p><p id=ejbw5f2Aeqqs data-wc=69>Mark and Michelle own a six-bedroom, three-bathroom property in Essex. It was previously reported that 32-year-old Mark borrowed money from his wife and sister, Jessica Wright, to convert a seven bedroom Essex mansion into four houses. According to documents filed with Companies House, Michelle loaned Mark's company, Chigwell Properties Limited, over £700,000 on 24 September 2015. One of the properties has since been listed on Right Move for £1,295,000.</p><h3>Who is Michelle Keegan's husband?</h3><p id=eD6dHIbVUjhj data-wc=133>After meeting in Dubai in 2012, Mark and Michelle immediately became one of TV's ultimate golden couples. Mark also has a pretty impressive fortune, with a net worth estimated to be around the £4million mark. The former footballer was given his first big break in The Only Way is Essex in 2010, which has since scored him appearances on I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! and Strictly Come Dancing. The Essex-born hunk then swiftly became a presenter of Take Me Out: The Gossip and hosted ITV2's Mark Wright's Hollywood Nights. In 2013, Mark landed a role as a reporter on popular ITV series Surprise Surprise. Away from the small screen, the reality-star-turned-presenter has also hosted his own radio show with Heart Radio and has modelled for his menswear range with Littlewood's.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/5f644a678f47-michelle-keegan-mark-wright-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=e0ItDG5T5ITe data-wc=7><strong>The actress is married to Mark Wright</strong></p><p id=ecNYJ1z17Ay1 data-wc=132>And while Mark made a name for himself alongside Mario Lopez in America, there have been rumours that Michelle would try and find her feet in Hollywood. However, when asked if she has considered making a move, Michelle told You Magazine: "Of course I've thought about it. But it's not that simple. I'm auditioning for work out in LA and if something good comes up I will take it and that will be great. But it has to be something I want to do." She added: "I've held out for really good parts on British television and I love working here. I think we make great drama in this country. I do love LA. It's always so sunny; it's so easy to be healthy and happy there. But I'm a northern girl."</p><p id=e5ccjk1R41eh data-wc=1><strong>MORE:</strong><a class=hm-link href=#> Michelle Keegan opens up about her transatlantic marriage to Mark Wright</a></p><p id=eQvMjIRxwVLD data-wc=63>The couple can now spend more time together after Mark ended his contract with Us show Speaking about his decision to leave to the presenter explained: "I was there for nearly two years and had the most amazing time, it just feels like the right time to come back to the UK and live here with my wife and family."</p><p id=eJYX1kqpsjcf data-wc=79>In February 2018, Mark revealed that his marriage to Michelle "will always come first" over his presenting career in the US.
