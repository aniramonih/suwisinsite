On Aug. 13, the comedian <a href=#>taped himself to a billboard</a> to promote his new comedy special, Gnarly. What is Steve-O’s net worth, how does the danger-obsessed comedian make his money, and are he and Jackass creator Johnny Knoxville still friends?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Steve-O’s interesting rise to fame</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Steve-O-1.jpg><p id=par-2_35>One of Jackass‘s biggest stars is a Wimbledon, London native who got his start in the most unlikely places. Through multiple childhood moves (at least six), Steve-O first attempted a “normal” shot at college life.</p><p id=par-3_42>He attended the University of Miami and the University of New Mexico. But, Steve-O soon found traditional schooling wasn’t his path. He eventually joined and graduated from Ringling Brothers and Barnum and Baily Circus Clown College but didn’t’ make the cut.</p><p id=par-4_45>This led to <a href=#>other clown work</a> in a flea market where he began filming his own stunts. He sent the videos to various outlets. Enter the Jackass franchise where Steve-O made a name for himself performing stunts and working <a href=#>alongside Johnny Knoxville</a> and Bam Margera.</p><p id=par-5_25>So far, there are five movies based on the MTV series and a spin-off, Jackass Presents: Bad Grandpa. Another Jackass film is set for 2021.</p><p id=par-6_36>Aside from his presence on Jackass, Steve-O continued putting his own material out and toured to promote the projects. Many of Steve-O’s performances include stunts performed live on stage and nearly <a href=#>all of them are controversial</a>.</p><p id=par-7_52>In 2002, Steve-O stapled his scrotum to his leg during a show and was arrested for obscenity along with second-degree battery charges. In 2003, he swallowed a cannabis-filled condom on camera and regurgitated it on stage in Sweden. He was arrested but the footage stayed on his film, Steve-O: Out on Bail.</p><p id=par-8_43>There are many more examples of the work Steve-O does to stay in the limelight. Some, as stated by Steve-O, came as a result of drug and alcohol use. He <a href=#>posted</a> to his social media pages celebrating 10 years of sobriety in 2018.</p><p id=par-9_27>Now, the Jackass star uploads videos to his YouTube page and has millions of subscribers. He’s also an author of the bestselling autobiography, Professional Idiot: A Memoir.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The downward spiral and how Steve-O made it to the other side</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-10_33>With over 10 years of sobriety, Steve-O managed to turn his life around — with a little help from his friends. He opened up about his experiences via <a href=#>In Depth with Graham Bensinger</a>.</p><p id=par-11_36>In the interview, he recalled his mother would offer him “just a little booze” to help calm him during flights and was also allowed alcohol on New Year’s Eve. Then began his<a href=#> dangerous relationship with drug-use</a>.</p><p id=par-12_23>“My favorites were Ketamine, cocaine, nitrous oxide, PCP, of course marijuana, alcohol. Oh, I loved Xanax so much, and Valium,” he said.</p><p id=par-13_55>“Never got too into meth, but I never turned it down. Had some pretty terrible experiences on magic mushrooms. Had a lot of great experience on LSD. Like, random, weird stuff. I huffed video head cleaner. There was this weird episode where I was drinking aluminum cleaner…and that would bring about some pretty disturbing incidents.”</p><p id=par-14_32>Things only worsened from there with Steve-O eventually landing in jail multiple times, in rehab, and the psychiatric ward. However, he managed to turn things around, thanks to a caring crew.</p><p id=par-15_68>“Hard to believe it’s been an entire decade since I’ve had a drink or a drug,” he <a href=#>posted</a> in honor of his 10-years of sobriety mark in 2018. “I just can’t put into words how grateful I am for @realjknoxville and the rest of the guys who locked me up in a psychiatric ward on March 9, 2008, where this journey began. Thank you, dudes, I love you.”&nbsp;</p><p id=par-16_15>Knoxville previously spoke out about his friendship with Steve-O — particularly witnessing the downward spiral.</p><p id=par-17_77>“We’d all had our eye on Steve-O because he’d gotten to a really bad point in doing all kinds of crazy drugs,” he said via <a href=#>E! News</a>. “But [when Steve-O’s] e-mails kind of hinted at suicide, I got 10 of our closest friends — big guys– and went to his house and said, ‘Steve-O, you know, we’re here to take you into the rehab, or actually 5150 medical hold,’ and he goes, ‘No dude, I ain’t going.'”</p><p id=par-18_28>He continued: “I said, ‘Steve-O, if you don’t go I’ve instructed the guys to knock you out and then we’ll take you.’ He’s like, ‘OK dude, I’ll go.'”</p><p id=par-19_14>In another interview, Knoxville said the two have been friends since the late 1990s.</p><p id=par-20_51>“Me and all his other friends — the Jackass guys — have been there the entire time,” Knoxville told <a href=#>MTV</a>. “We were there before he got into show business before he was on Jackass, and we were there when he completely, absolutely spun out of control and almost lost his life.”</p><p id=par-21_32>Knoxville and the Jackass crew helped Steve-O through a lot. And with another Jackass movie in the works, they’re still up to their old shenanigans. Only this time, <a href=#>they’ll do it sober</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Steve-O’s net worth</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-22_30>Considering all the adventures Steve-O gets himself into, it’s clear why he’s worth a pretty penny. According to <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a>, the stuntman is worth an estimated $2.5 million.</p><p id=par-23_25>He makes his money through the Jackass franchise as well as his own video projects, stand-up comedy tours, authorship, and cameos in other projects.</p><p id=par-24_19><strong>How to get help: </strong>In the U.S., contact the <a href=#>Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration</a> helpline at 1-800-662-4357.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTEqa3TZqCsZZqWsKyt0qxkrKyRp3q0wMSvnGano2K7psCMsKarrJhirq%2BwjKKqZqCVYsC1tculZJ%2BqmZq7pb%2BMsKCtoF2fvKm6zbJkpKafrcOquMueZaGsnaF8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
