Her mother, <strong>Francine Lons</strong>, was a drug addict and couldn’t take care of her. She went to prison. As a result, <strong>Leon and Yvonne Cole</strong>, her family friends, adopted her. From there, she got her last name, ‘Cole.’</p><p>In 2016, after finding results from a DNA test, she met her biological father for the first time. He was a boxing trainer. Although they are her biological parents, she considers ‘Leon’ and ‘Yvonne’ as her real parents because a parents duty is not only to give birth to a child. They should also nurture their children.</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rae Sremmurd Net Worth, Age, Bio, Career, Personal Life >></a></h4><p>After achieving success in life through tough work and commitment, she gives all credits to her parents (not biological parents).

Details regarding her education and the colleges that she attended are unknown at this time.</p><h2>Keyshia Cole Career</h2><p>She had developed an interest in singing when she was a child after she met Tupac Shakur and MC Hammer. Tupac was responsible for starting her career in music. But, his unfortunate death could not make it possible.</p><p>Although Tupac didn’t play a role in starting her career, she started in the industry by working with Messy Marv and D’Wayne Wiggings. When she crossed eighteen, she went to Los Angeles to pursue her career. Her unfinished single “Love,” which was released in 2002 attracted the attention of A&M Records, and that led to a recording deal.</p><p>Moreover, her debut album “The Way It Is,” which was released in 2005, became an enormous hit. It’s singles like “I Changed My Mind,” “(I Just Want It) To Be Over,” and “Love” became a huge hit, with “Love” gaining no. 19 positions on US Hot 100 and no. 1 on US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs.</p><h2>Keyshia Cole Net Worth</h2><p>Cole is not only a fantastic singer but also a businesswoman and a Reality TV star. Her first TV show, “Keyshia Cole: The Way it is,” which aired for three seasons, became BET’s most-watched program in history.

After three years, in 2017, their divorce was finalized.</p><p>She has a son whom she gave birth before she married. His name is <strong>Daniel Hiram Gibson, Jr</strong>. They have been pretty quiet since their divorce, and we do not have much knowledge regarding their dating life. We only have rumors. Cole was once linked to <strong>Floyd Mayweather</strong>.
