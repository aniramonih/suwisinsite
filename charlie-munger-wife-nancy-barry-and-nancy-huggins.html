In the business world, he was most notably the vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, a conglomerate controlled by Warren Buffett.

Following his outstanding performance on the Army General Classification Test, he was given orders to attend Caltech in Pasadena, California, to study meteorology. Munger’s relationship with the town that would eventually become his home began with this.</p><p>Charles Thomas Munger took advantage of the GI Bill’s educational opportunities by enrolling in a series of advanced courses offered by various universities. His interest in law led him to apply to Harvard Law School, a school associated with his father.</p><p>Initially rejected due to the lack of an undergraduate degree, Munger’s admission to Harvard Law was aided by the intervention of Roscoe Pound, a prominent figure in legal education and a family friend. The dean of admissions reconsidered and admitted Munger to the prestigious law school as a result of Pound’s influence.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ghbase.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/FRsLXGaaAAAGnK4-960x540.jpg><h2 id=h-meet-nancy-huggins-the-first-wife-of-charlie-munger class=wp-block-heading><strong>Meet Nancy Huggins, the first wife of Charlie Munger</strong></h2><p>Charles Thomas Munger married Nancy Huggins, daughter of Frederick R. and Edith M.
