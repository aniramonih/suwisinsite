Her husband? He was two years older. The couple invited their nearest and dearest — including the likes of John Travolta and his late wife, Kelly Preston, plus Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson, and their children from previous relationships — according to <a href=#>People</a>, and said their vows on the two-year anniversary of their first date. Streisand's close friend, Marilyn Bergman, probably summed it up best when it came to their long wait for true love, saying immediately after their wedding, "In all the years I've known Barbra, I've seen her happy, but always with a cloud. This time it was a clear blue sky." How sweet!</p><p>And it sounds like all that life experience the couple had before has only made their marriage stronger. "I learned about handling Barbra from my previous marriages, and we've been terrific," Brolin told <a href=#>The Guardian</a> in June, revealing that they laugh together when they hear any kind of rumors of marriage drama in the tabloids. He also shared how his past romances helped him financially to <a href=#>"HuffPost Live"</a> in 2015, admitting he'd learned the best thing to do is have separate bank accounts. "This is my third marriage, and I know what trouble can come out of marriage, so I didn't want any reason that I would ever have to be either divorced or married again," he explained.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcnFmaX51e8eeqZ6rXZ28uHnOpZtmmpGnr7OtjKyrq52ZqK6vsIywmKxlp52yr3nSoZxmpZGnv6qxw2ahmqWVqHqjvs6loKdn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
