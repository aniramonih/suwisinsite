Al Dasim 5/2</a></h4><p>This three year-old has already won four in a row, three of them over course and distance.</p><p>Including the Nad Al Sheba Turf Sprint earlier this month by over two lengths and clearly has lots of running left in him to reach his ceiling mark.</p><p>He's up 6lb for that to 112 for trainer George Boughey and regular rider Mickael Barzalona retains the mount this weekend.</p><h4><a href=#>4.00: Dubai Sheema Classic tip - Rebel's Romance 6/1 each-way</a></h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2023/03/GettyImages-1439298279.jpg><p>The Godolphin horse is a multiple Group 1 winner and is a remarkably high price for this race that's just a few days away.</p><p>Rebel's Romance beat Stone Age by two and a quarter lengths in the Breeders' Cup and has won six of his seven attempts in Stakes races.</p><p>He's even won five in a row from June 2022 to November 2022 which include runs in the US, Britain, and Germany.</p><h4><a href=#>4.35: Dubai World Cup tip - Country Grammer 5/2</a></h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2023/03/GettyImages-1239524730.jpg><p>Now for the huge feature race with 15 runners lining up to take home the £6 million.</p><p>With even placing in the top six offering millions for these flat trainers and jockeys from around the world.</p><p>There's a strong showing from Japan in this race but the US Bob Baffert-trained horse Country Grammer is the early leader ahead of Algiers trained by Simon & Ed Crisford, based in Newmarket.</p><p>He's just 4/1 and has shown real promise on the Fibresand winning twice at Meydan under Doyle in January and February.</p><p>But it's Country Grammer that should make all in this if he gets a decent break.</p><p>Under Dettori last time in the Saudi Cup, he was ridden in midfield and then challenged to the line from the outside and was just three quarters of a length away from the winner.</p><p>The stall numbers will give a much better indication to chances come the draw later this week.</p><p>But Country Grammer already has over £11 million in earnings and should be taken seriously at 5/2, having won this last year.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">talkSPORT BET OFFER</h3></p><p>Bet £10 Get £30 In Free Bets -
