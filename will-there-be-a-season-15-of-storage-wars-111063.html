(A&E/ Twitter) By Victoria Priola, eCommerce writer Abandoned storage units will find new homes again this week thanks to experts who know how to make a profit. “Storage Wars” Season 14 premieres on A&E on Tuesday, March 8, at 9 p.m. ET/PT.</p><p><strong>Casey and Rene Nezhoda will be back for season 15</strong>. However, other cast members have kept their lips sealed about whether they will feature on the upcoming episodes, which is likely down to an A&E contact. Brandi returned for the last season with new partner Bozek, so it is thought they will also be back for more episodes.</p><p>According to the A&E website for Storage Wars, there were a total of 10 episodes for Season 13. Unfortunately, all 10 episodes have already aired on television. In fact, it has been a few weeks now since a new episode was on TV.</p><p>Be sure to watch Storage Wars Season 14, on Tuesday nights at 9 p.m. Eastern, on A&E. Georgia Makitalo has been a freelance writer for 14 years. She enjoys writing about Hallmark, Lifetime, GAC, UPtv, and anything Austen.</p><p>Yes-namely, the triumphant return of Weiss, who has been gone from the show for eight seasons. Auctioneers Dan and Laura Dotson are thrilled that Weiss has returned to Storage Wars. “ Barry is like a circus act 24/7,” says Laura. “Everybody who watches the show, and the reruns, is always talking about Barry.</p><p>Storage Warsfollows auctioneers and buyers in California’s risky world of unclaimed storage units. The reality show brings viewers on a thrilling hunt for the next great find, joining A&Eauctioneer icons Dan and Laura Dotson as they facilitate the rapid-fire sale of abandoned treasures.</p><h2>What episode of A&E is the final approach?</h2><p>Season 13, Episode<strong> 10</strong> titled, “A Plane Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest” aired on May 25th. The synopsis of the episode declared the A&E gang was on their “final approach.”. Unfortunately, this leads us to believe<strong> Episode 10</strong> was the Season 13 Finale. This means Season 12 was actually six episodes shorter than Season 12.</p><p>Jarrod would no longer be a cast member. So, if the show comes back for Season 14….<strong> There is a chance Jarrod would</strong> not<strong> be coming back with it.</strong> Unfortunately, there isn’t a lot of concrete information on the future of Storage Wars.</p><p>So, the short answer to this question is:<strong> yes, Storage Wars Season 13 appears to be over.</strong></p><h2>How many seasons of Storage Wars are there?</h2><p>This is the world of Storage Wars, an A&E reality TV series that aired for<strong> 12 season </strong>s<strong> from 2010 to 2019.</strong> The inner workings of storage law didn’t draw in millions of viewers each week so much as the show’s regular and recurring cast of characters — real-life treasure and bargain seekers, and auctioneers, from different walks …</p><p>He sued network A&E and Original Productions for $750,000, citing wrongful termination. He alleged that<strong> Storage Wars was heavily juiced to guarantee good TV.</strong></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>According to Radar Online, the reality star entered a guilty plea in 2009 on a charge of transport of a controlled substance, for which he received a sentence of<strong> 60 days</strong> in jail and three years probation.</p><p>Before he was Storage Wars ‘ self-proclaimed “King of Palmdale,” Ivy Calvin (a regular on the show from season five onward) was a<strong> non-televised auction hunter,</strong> spending years traveling around the U.S. looking for gems to resell at his thrift shop, Grandma’s Attic. And before that, he was a professional athlete, playing in the Arena Football League (per the Los Angeles Times ), and fighting in the mixed martial arts circuit. (He competed in one match, winning a cage fight against Samu Samu.) The whole auction-and-thrifting gig was at one time a supplement to his job as a high school football coach… before it made him a reality TV star, that is.</p><p>When Justin Bryant joined the cast of Storage Wars for its final stretch of episodes, he was just<strong> 22 years</strong> old, making him the youngest bidder and buyer in the show’s history. Storage Wars had been airing for so long by that point that it’s what directly inspired Bryant to give storage locker buying a shot.</p><p>Auctioneers<strong> Dan and Laura Dotson</strong> ruled the Storage Wars roost with their unique set of skills up until season 10, when Emily Wears joined the cast. Born into a family of auctioneers, Wears proved to be a prodigy, working for her father’s Iowa company at age 10 and beginning her training (which included bilingual calling) at 17. She won a slew of titles as a teenager before moving onto reality TV, which before Storage Wars included stints on another Thom Beers auction series Money Barn, and American Idol. It would seem that Wears can sing almost as well as she auctioneers, although judges Keith Urban, Jennifer Lopez, and Harry Connick, Jr., all voted against letting her proceed in the talent competition series.</p><p>Storage Wars: Texas featured a cast member already famous before and outside of reality television. After buyers Ricky and Bubba Smith tracked down Oklahoma Sooners and Dallas Cowboys star Roy Williams to verify his supposed signature on some sports memorabilia they’d acquired, the ex-defensive back went along on some auctions with the duo. Logically nicknamed “The Player,” Williams made memorable appearances throughout seasons one and two of Storage Wars: Texas.</p><p><h3 class=jp-relatedposts-headline>Related</h3></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivmaC2b6%2FEpZybqpmpxm%2ByzGiuoqScYsGpsdGeZJudXZZ6tLHArKanZWFqerCyjKyrqKqRnLJuw8CrqmZpYWZ9d3%2BO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
