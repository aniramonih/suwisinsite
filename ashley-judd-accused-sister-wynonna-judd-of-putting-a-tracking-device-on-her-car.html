Because Ashley can’t explain anything succinctly or clearly (seriously, <a href=#>have you heard her speak</a>?) ABC News doesn’t know how to report this story other than to repeat the confusing details in the police report. When you <a href=#>read TMZ’s version</a>, they make the situation pretty clear. The car was being driven by Wynonna’s teenage daughter, and that’s why someone placed a tracker on it. Wynonna wanted to know what her daughter was up to. I gather from these two stories that Ashley has custody of Wynonna’s daughter. Here’s TMZ’s version:</p><p>Wynonna Judd is being accused of attempting to secretly track her sister Ashley Judd’s every move … by placing a GPS tracking device on her car.</p><p>The incident was first reported to police back in November when Wynonna’s daughter drove Ashley’s car to a mechanic … and asked them to check for a tracking device — according to reports.</p><p>The GPS device was located … so they reported it to police — and an investigation was launched to figure out who put it there.</p><p>According to the police report … when cops contacted Ashley asking if she had any idea who placed the device on her ride — Ashley pointed the finger at Wynonna.</p><p>Detectives tried in vain to reach Wynonna … so they contacted the P.I. to whom the device was registered — but they got the cold shoulder.</p><p>Wynonna’s lawyer eventually called police — and said the whole thing was a misunderstanding … the singer was just trying to track her daughter whom she knew had been driving the vehicle.</p><p><a href=#>[From TMZ]</a></p><p><a href=#>ABC News has more</a>, including the detail that the tracker may have placed on the car by Wynonna’s ex, her first husband, Arch Kelley, not Wynonna. (Although Kelley denies this, and it sounds like Wynonna admitted to TMZ that she was the one who arranged for the tracker.) Kelley has two kids with Wynonna, 17 year-old daughter, Grace, and 18 year-old son, Elijah. (Kelley is not the horrible excuse for a human being who was convicted of attempted aggravated sexual battery against a minor, <a href=#>that was Wynonna’s second ex-husband</a>, her former bodyguard D. R. Roach.)</p><p>So instead of realizing that Wynonna or her ex husband was tracking their teenage daughter, Ashley called the cops. This points to a pretty intense family feud. I want to know the details behind what happened, but even if Ashley tells the press everything it still won’t make sense. We’ll have to wade through a <a href=#>word salad so deep</a> that it won’t be worth the effort to get to the truth.</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/wenn20216277-738x1024.jpg alt="Los Angeles Premiere of 'Olympus Has Fallen'" width=500 sizes="(max-width: 738px) 100vw, 738px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/wenn20205638-682x1024.jpg alt="Wynonna Judd arriving at LAX Airport" width=500 sizes="(max-width: 682px) 100vw, 682px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/FFN_DWTS_Rehearsals_MAL_032113_51044486-813x1024.jpg alt='"Dancing With The Stars" Celebs Go To Rehearsals' width=500 sizes="(max-width: 813px) 100vw, 813px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Ashley is shown at the premiere of Olympus Has Fallen in March.
