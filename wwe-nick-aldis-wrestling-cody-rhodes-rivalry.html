While it was great to finally see Aldis in WWE, and with a prominent role, the moment was also a bit awkward. The crowd reaction was minimal, as WWE did nothing to tell their casual fans who Aldis is. For those who did know Aldis, they wanted to see him come to the company as a wrestler and not just an onscreen role.</p><p>Nick Aldis addressed this latter critique in an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Busted Open Radio</a>, saying, "I’d already made the decision that whatever opportunity, if any, ever came from the WWE, I would take it. You’ve only got one chance in the game, and that’s to play, no matter how that comes along. I had a brief conversation with Paul Heyman the other night, and I said, ‘Hey, opportunity comes in all shapes and sizes.’ He said, ‘Yes, it does.’ I was excited. I really was. I know that people will hear that and be like, ‘Oh, bulls**t.’ But I’ve enjoyed tremendously the other hats that I’ve worn in this business, particularly in the last few years. I don’t think it’s any secret at this point that my fingerprints were all over my previous employer, as far as the product and everything like that, beyond my contributions as a talent.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"So I do find it very rewarding, and it is something, certain guys are well-suited to it, and certain guys are not... I’m ready, willing and able to contribute to WWE in any way I can. I stand by that, and I appreciate everybody who wants to see me in different capacities. As far as I’m concerned, I’m just over the moon to be part of the process in any way. If other stuff comes along, those opportunities, you can bet that I’ll be ready, willing, and able." (h/t <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fightful</a>)</p><p>A hypothetical was also brought up. What if Cody Rhodes wins the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship at WrestleMania 40 from Roman Reigns and gives a title shot to Nick Aldis? To that, Aldis said, “I will say, Cody and I, [our] rivalry, chemistry, story is sort of undeniable. He knows where I am., and I know where he is, and never say never."

At the inaugural All In, Rhodes beat Aldis for the NWA Championship, <a href=#>before Aldis regained it just over a month later</a>. It was a great feud that showed what Rhodes and Aldis could do, even without a major company like WWE pushing them. Now that they are both in WWE, it seems like the perfect opportunity for them to meet in the ring again. With Aldis only 36-years-old, it's hard to imagine that his wrestling career is over. Hopefully, his GM role is a way to introduce him to a new audience before he begins competing again.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKeoqqSowaa%2BjZympmenrLJuusicomaZnJm2tHnWq5ysrJyeu6h5wqibsmWinbylsdJmqaKukaG%2Funs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
