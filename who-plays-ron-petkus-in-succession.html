Recommended Videos The third episode of Succession left viewers with their jaws on the floor after the shocking death of Logan Roy (Played by Brian Cox). We knew it was coming, but to have it happen so early on in the season was a bold move on the writer’s part. The latest episode deals with the inevitable fallout of the previous events, seeing members of the Roy family squabble over who is the preferred successor."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

He also makes a regular appearance alongside <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bill Hader</a> in another HBO series, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Barry,</a> as Monroe Fuches. Coincidentally, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Barry is also starting it’s fourth season.</a></p><p data-characters=294 data-current-count=294 data-injectable=false>Will Root be making any more appearances in Succession? It’s unlikely. The show has seven episodes left before it concludes for good, and the show’s writers will probably want to focus on the main drama of the story. That probably won’t bother Root much, as he seems busy enough as it is.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tM5mp6WZqah6s7vNZqeerJuqwG61zWaqrpuTmsC0tc6nZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
