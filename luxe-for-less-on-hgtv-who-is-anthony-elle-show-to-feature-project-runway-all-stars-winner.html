The new series features Atlanta’s top interior designer Michel Boyd remodeling homes into some of the most <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">luxurious abodes</a>, but all under a tight budget. The designer will use some neat tricks and hacks to give his client’s homes a plush makeover while ensuring that the expenses are a fraction of the actual cost of luxury.</p><p>To help Michel with his daunting task, three design-oriented professionals will be at his beck and call.

Many will recognize the designer from HGTV’s ‘Rock The Block’ in which he is set to star alongside Michel. Some eagle-eyed fans will also recognize Anthony from ‘Project Runway’, a show where he was a recurring contestant. But during his ‘Project Runway’ days, Anthony went by the name Anthony Williams. After winning ‘Project Runway All Stars’ Season 6, the designer changed his name to Anthony Elle to create his Anthony Elle fashion and lifestyle brand.</p><p>Anthony turned to reality TV after his pageant career ended in 2006. He started his stint in reality TV with ‘Project Runway’ Season 7. According to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Marie Claire</a>, despite finishing fifth, a challenge win landed his blue one-shouldered dress on model and host Heidi Klum for a cover of Marie Claire. The fan favorite returned for the first season of ‘Project Runway All Stars’ in 2012 and placed ninth. Anthony returned for Season 6 of the show and finally bagged the title of winner with his seven 'vintage-meets-eclectic' looks that he showcased in his finale collection. The collection was filled with hand-painted details, fitted silhouettes, and bare shoulders inspired by Rihanna and Audrey Hepburn.</p><p>Anthony is currently based in Atlanta, where his atelier is situated. He has carved out a distinctive niche in the ever-changing world of DIY and couture. According to Anthony’s <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">website</a>, “His work as a costume designer has been featured on VH1’s ‘Single Ladies’, as well as ‘November Rule’ and ‘The Trapp’ on Netflix. Through film and television, Elle has dressed celebrities such as Queen Latifah, Heidi Klum, Paula Patton, LaLa Anthony, Letoya Luckett, and Billy Porter. As an entertainment personality, Elle has made appearances on HLN as a guest commentator, as well as the HBO Max, hit show 'Craftopia' with host Laura Rii Himaki, where his witty personality and engaging presence were ever present. Recently Elle landed his first acting role on ‘How High 2’ playing the role of Quenton on Netflix. In between TV opportunities, Anthony continues to design custom couture gowns under the Anthony Elle label.”</p><p>Catch the innovative Anthony Elle as he assists the design expert Michel Boyd in ‘Luxe For Less’ set to premiere on Thursday, December 1 at 9/8c on HGTV.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRopKWtsm6yzqtkpZ2jqHqwuoyhnq2uXay1sHnIrGSapqSdvK%2FFjJ6jpZ1dqLWww4ytpmaelZbBtr7EZqerp5qasLV50a6lsJmpYq6tuIysq5qqo2LEqrrNnqk%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
