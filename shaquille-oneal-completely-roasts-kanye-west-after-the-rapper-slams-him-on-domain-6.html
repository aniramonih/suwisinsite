The rapper <a href=#>tweeted</a> out an image of Shaquille O'Neal along with a caption that questioned his business practices. "Shaq is in business with Jamie Salter," he wrote, making reference to a "50/50" deal the two men have. "I said 'Jame . . . There's no such thing as 50/50 in business . . . Who has the extra 1 percent for the control and voting rights."</p><p dir=ltr>The message is somewhat confusing — though it seems like there's an accusation in there somewhere — and it received little engagement. Regardless, O'Neal stepped in to clear the air. "Believe me you don't know me like that," O'Neal&nbsp;<a href=#>replied</a>. "To quote the once great Kanye west 'I got more money than you, so why would i listen to you.'" The diss quickly garnered over 100,000 likes.</p><p dir=ltr>O'Neal works with Salter on Authentic Brands Group, which recently made the major acquisition of Reebok. In conversation with <a href=#>Footwear Nation</a>, O'Neal and Salter had nothing but kind things to say about their partnership. "I met with a lot of companies, but when I met with Jamie and his family, I knew that this was the right place to be," the former NBA star shared. Salter, meanwhile, credited O'Neal as "the hardest-working person in showbiz."&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamhoa4N2gI6sn5qppZ65rbGMqKWemZxisLC5z6WcrZ2crnqzu8Csq6xlm5a7urGMsJysrF2Ws7Wx0WaroZ1dp66xvMSrZKykkaLAbrTIpmSopl2ZvK6tyKeWb2c%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
