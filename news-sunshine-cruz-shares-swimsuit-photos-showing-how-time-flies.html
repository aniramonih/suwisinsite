In a new social media post, the Filipino singer and actress shows off her amazing body in a bathing suit from today and almost three decades ago. "46 & 17 ☺️How time flies!" she captioned the Instagram post. How does she keep herself looking forever young? Celebwell rounded up her top health tips.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Sunshine suggests finding workouts you love. "I exercise three to four times a week, even if it's less than an hour," she told </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Pep.Ph</span></a><span>. "I think it's really important that we also enjoy the workouts we do."</span><span aria-hidden=true>df44d9eab23ea271ddde7545ae2c09ec</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/shutterstock_721787479.jpg><p><span>Sunshine does spinning and boxing, "because those are the workouts I enjoy the most," she said. The </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Cleveland Clinic </span></a><span>explains that biking, a low-impact aerobic exercise, is great for building muscle, improving strength and flexibility, and improving balance. It can also boost mental health and help other health conditions, including arthritis. </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Harvard Health</span></a><span> maintains that boxing is a great way to build strength, improve balance, posture, hand-eye coordination, boost mood and endurance, and helps increase alertness.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>With regard to her diet, "I eat mostly protein and less carbs but every weekend, those are my cheat days. So I eat what I've been craving for on the weekends," she said.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/shutterstock_1968147166.jpg><p><span>Sunshine reminds us that to be healthy, you need to set goals. "It's really necessary to be focused and have priorities, and, at the same time, I owe it to myself, to be healthy," she told Pep.Ph.</span></p><p><span>While most people stay away from carbohydrates, Cruz eats rice three meals a day. "For breakfast, I have fried rice with Spam and vegetables. I've got to set an example to my children. If they don't see me eat veggies, they won't, too," she told </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Lifestyle.Inq</span></a><span>.</span></p><p><span>"When I feel bloated, I do more," Sunshine revealed. One of her favorite workouts is dancing. "I don't perspire, but Zumba makes me sweat." Dancing is a great workout for many reasons. Not only does it build strength and promote flexibility, but helps you lose weight and even promotes cardiovascular function. A 2016 study published in the </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>American Journal of Preventive Medicine </span></a><span>determined that people who engaged in moderate-intensity dancing were 46 percent less likely to develop heart disease or die from it than non-dancers. In comparison, moderate-intensity walkers were just 25 percent less likely to suffer heart health issues.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifK%2Bx1qxkrK2eqLWqusRmmqutqmLAqa3Rnqpmq6eeurTByK1kqaCfqby0edKhprChnpx6qbvWZquipZVis621xKxm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
