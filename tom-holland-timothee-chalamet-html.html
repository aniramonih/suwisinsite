The young actor will be appearing in Adam McKay’s satire Don’t Look Up, premiering in theaters on December 10th (<a href=#>The Guardian</a>). But Chalamet has also been considered for another role. This consideration comes from none other than your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man, Tom Holland. <a href=#>Screenrant</a> is reporting that Holland thought Chalamet would be a good choice for sometimes best friend, Harry Osborn.&nbsp;</p><p>Harry Osborn has been featured in the previous two franchises played by James Franco and Dane DeHaan. It seems unlikely that Marvel will go in that direction again so soon after the reboot. But Tom Holland has some logic to his hypothetical situation. “(Chalamet would) be a good Harry Osborn,” states Holland. “I think it would be good to bring him in as a FOS (friend of Spider-Man) and then he kind of becomes bad. And then he could be a villain. He’d be a good villain.”&nbsp;</p><p>Tom Holland has a good point in this respect. Timothee Chalamet has demonstrated his ability to play various roles. One of his first roles was in Greta Gerwig’s coming-of-age film Ladybird. He played Kyle, a disastrous love interest for Ladybird (Saoirse Ronan). That wasn’t the last time that Chalamet and Ronan would star opposite each other either. They appeared in Gerwig’s follow-up Little Women as Laurie and Jo respectively. But Chalamet is most popular for one of his most recent ventures. The actor’s newest claim to fame is Paul Atreides; the Lisan al Gaib, Muad’Dib, and Kwisatz Haderach in Denis Villeneuve’s Dune. Dune was one of the year’s most highly anticipated film.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/timothee-chalamet-dune-900x450.jpg><p>Timothee Chalamet may be up to the challenge of playing an outright villain next. Whether it comes to pass or not, fans cannot wait to see Tom Holland in Spider-Man: Far From Home. The upcoming film has been notable for the rumors surrounding it. Most exciting are the <a href=#>villains set to appear</a> in the Spider-Man film. Alfred Molina and Willem Dafoe will be reprising their villainous roles from the Sam Raimi Spider-Man franchise. This has whipped fans up into a frenzy, hoping to spot their Spider-Men counterparts <a href=#>Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield</a>. Andrew Garfield has been particularly vocal about not appearing in the film (<a href=#>CBR</a>). But knowing Marvel and their extreme secrecy, this could just be a ruse.&nbsp;</p><p>True to the new Spider-Man phase, many of the characters that audiences are familiar with have not appeared in the Holland films. Mary Jane was retooled into MJ (Zendaya). No longer a model or actress, the new Spider-Man’s MJ is rebellious and sarcastic, often feeling like an outsider. Other changes include the decision not to feature the death of Uncle Ben. The films pick up after Peter has already been bitten by the spider.</p><p>It may not even come to pass that Tom Holland gets to see a live-action Harry Osborn. Holland mused about the potential of stepping back from Spider-Man in an interview with <a href=#>GQ</a>. While this has not been confirmed by Marvel, Holland stated that Miles Morales may take up the mantle sooner rather than later. Holland has since clarified what he meant in the interview. He has no plans to step away immediately, to the relief of fans. “What I was referring to, in that interview, it’s because I would be taking up an opportunity for someone to come in and change what being Spider-Man means. Spider-Man could be more diverse, it could be a female character, it could be anything,” <a href=#>Digital Spy</a> reported. Perhaps fans will get a Holland-Chalamet team up one day in the future.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2isn6J6qbvLpZinnF2ptq6706GcnmWTna6trcyeq2egpKK5</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
