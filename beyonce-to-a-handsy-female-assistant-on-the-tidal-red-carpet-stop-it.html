It absolutely cracks me up that so many people were calling her out on her lace-front wiglet. I mean, yes, it’s obviously a wig, but doesn’t Beyonce almost always wear wigs when she’s out in public for formal events/red carpets? Meanwhile, everybody was talking about a moment Beyonce had on the red carpet with some assistant-type who wouldn’t stop fussing with Bey’s dress. This poor assistant will never be the same now that Bey has told her to “Stop it.”</p><p>To be fair to Beyonce, what kind of dumb assistant stands IN FRONT OF their employer while she’s walking a carpet? If you have to fuss with the dress, do it quickly and from the side. Don’t get in between the cameras and the Beyonce. That assistant deserved that “Stop it.” Do not touch the Beyonce. Do not stand in front of the Beyonce. Do not make the Beyonce tell you to STOP IT. Also: it’s pretty funny that Beyonce will not be speaking on behalf of Beyonce anymore and so “Stop it” is the first non-musical thing she’s said in public in, like, a year.</p><p>Meanwhile, there are some others pieces of Beyonce news. Apparently, an unauthorized biography of Jay-Z is about to be published and there are all sorts of scandalous stories in there, like how Jay and Beyonce broke up in 2005 because he couldn’t deal with her career-focus. Jay also had something going with Rihanna when Rih was just a teenager and Beyonce always worried about that time and “Rihanna has always been a sore subject” for Beyonce. <a href=#>Go here to read more about that</a>.</p><p>Also, <a href=#>Jay was on Jimmy Kimmel Live on Tuesday</a> and they ended up chatting about pizza. Jay is apparently really serious about his thin-crust New York pizza (he goes to Lucali in Brooklyn for the best slices) and Jay admitted that Beyonce’s taste in pizza drives him crazy. Bey loves extra tomato sauce and jalapeños and Jay explained it as: “She’s from Houston, first of all. They don’t have pizza there.”</p><p>DO NOT TOUCH THE BEYONCE.</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/wenn23048275.jpg alt=wenn23048275 width=500 sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/wenn23048266.jpg alt=wenn23048266 width=500 sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Photos courtesy of WENN.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZmbW1iboNxe8GesKimk5qstbu%2BmpahmZ6ZwLqrxZ6kmqSVlK60v8isq5qmpJS8r6vToZyYrJmZrq2r0Z6bmJuRp72mwL6sq6ioj57BcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
