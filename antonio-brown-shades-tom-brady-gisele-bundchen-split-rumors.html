Seeing my children succeed and become the beautiful little humans that they are, seeing him succeed, and being fulfilled in his career — it makes me happy. At this point in my life, I feel like I’ve done a good job on that.”</p><p class=p1>She added at the time: “Obviously, I have my concerns [with him returning to football] — this is a very violent sport, and I have my children and <a href=#>I would like him to be more present</a>. I have definitely had those conversations with him over and over again. But ultimately, I feel that everybody has to make a decision that works for [them]. He needs to follow his joy, too.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/antonio-brown-shades-former-teammate-tom-brady-and-gisele-bundchen-living-separately-amid-split-rumors-inline.jpg><p class=p1>While both Brady and the former Victoria’s Secret Angel appear to be at odds, the TB12 founder also h<a href=#>as had a rocky relationship</a> with Brown.</p><p class=p1>“It’s nothing personal, Tom is&nbsp;actually one of my close friends,” the&nbsp;<i><a href=#>Masked Singer</a>&nbsp;</i>alum said <a href=#>during a January appearance on the “Full Send” podcast</a>, noting why he didn’t follow his former Bucs teammate. “Some people have a different definition of a friend because when I say you’re gonna be a friend, that means I got your back. To me though, that’s what a friend means.”</p><p class=p1>Brown continued: “Brady can’t do s—t by himself. But, you guys going to make it seem like he’s just this heroic guy. Bro, we all humans. Bro, we’re all dependent on somebody else to do the job.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>The California native did not address Brown’s claims at the time, but previously asked fans to show empathy after his former teammate’s mid-game departure. (Hours earlier, the Florida native stunned football viewers when <a href=#>he threw off his jersey and left the stadium</a>, announcing his exit from the team.)</p><p class=p1>“I think everybody should do what they can to help in ways that he really needs it. We all love him. We care about him deeply,” Brady <a href=#>said during a press conference in January</a>. “We want to see him be at his best, and unfortunately, it won’t be with our team.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaapqSku6q7jJupqK%2BeYsCprcOeqmasn6J6o77AnbBmn5mosq2xjJusp5yTnbKvedKpo6KsXafCrrvRrGY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
