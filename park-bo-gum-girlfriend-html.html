He was the first actor on&nbsp;Forbes Korea&nbsp;to be on top of the Korea Power Celebrity list. His work is very well known to his fans, but very little information is known about his personal life.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>While he makes his fan's heart flutter with a single&nbsp;look, people have various questions surrounding his love life. For example, people wonder if he is gay or if he has a girlfriend or a wife.&nbsp;</p><p>Here is everything we know about Bo-gum's relationships.&nbsp;</p><h2>Park Bo-Gum's Ideal Partner</h2><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Bo-gum did an elaborate photo session and interview with Elle Korea in 2016. During the interview, Elle Korea used the official SNS account to collect questions from fans regarding Bo-gum. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Fans asked many questions, but a&nbsp;prominent one out of those was about his <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">ideal partner</a>. The actor&nbsp;had a pretty specific response to the question, as if he had thought about it before.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>His ideal spouse would be a cross between a friend and a mother. Of course, not in an incestuous manner, but someone who made him feel as at ease as a friend and would look after him as if a mother would tender to a&nbsp;child.</p><p>It seems like Bo-gum has not found his ideal partner yet, but many rumors are surrounding him and other South Korean actresses. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>List of Park Bo-Gum's Rumored Girlfriends</h2><p>There is no information about whether Bo-gum actually had a girlfriend or if he is currently in a relationship. However, he has been linked with many actresses he has worked with.&nbsp;</p><p>Here is the list of&nbsp;Bo-Gum’s <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">rumored girlfriends</a>.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><h3><strong>Jang Na Ra</strong></h3><p>In 2015, Jang Na Ra appeared alongside Bo-gum&nbsp;in the KBS drama I Remember You. However, the speculation&nbsp;of relationship and marriage started in early 2016, after the actor&nbsp;wore a ring during a fan signing session for Reply 1998. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>During an interview, Bo-gum addressed the rumors, saying he was&nbsp;surprised by the buzz since none of it was true.</p><h3><strong>Kim Yoo Jung</strong></h3><p>Kim Yoo Jung is a South Korean actress and model who was allegedly&nbsp;dating Bo-gum. Both of them starred in the 2016 drama Moonlight Drawn By Clouds.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>After working together, they became friends and even traveled to other countries together. The two were also <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">pictured together</a> in an airport. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Bo-gum's kind gesture was misunderstood as a romantic connection. So, the actress quickly debunked the allegations, saying she regarded him as a brother and that they were close friends, nothing else.</p><h3><strong>Irene</strong></h3><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Red Velvet's Irene used to co-host a popular music show, Music Bank, with Bo-gum. People mistook their professional connections for a romantic relationship because they acted like a couple on the program.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Bo-gum stated that he was ready for a relationship, but neither made a formal remark about their romantic connections. However, Irene later addressed the speculations and said she knew nothing about the news.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><h3><strong>Yoona</strong></h3><p>Fans adored Girls Generation's Yoona and Bo-gum since they looked great together in Hyori's Bed & Breakfast.&nbsp;Since then, the pair had taken over social media with the buzz of their relationship. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>But, once again, they were only rumors.</p><h3><strong>Song Hye-kyo</strong></h3><p>Recently, Bo-gum was linked with another actress, Song Hye-kyo. Following her <a href=# rel=follow>divorce from&nbsp;Song Joong-ki</a>, the news about the actress allegedly having extra-martial relationships surfaced.&nbsp;</p><p>According to the reports, the actress and Bo-gum had been having an affair while Hye-kyo was married to her ex-husband. Bo-gum and Hye-kyo worked together on&nbsp;Encounter, which fueled the rumors.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-174 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Apparently, their&nbsp;"inappropriate connection" was the catalyst for Hye-kyo's divorce. Because the allegations affected Bo-gum's image, his agency, Blossom Entertainment, issued a formal statement denying the reports.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKiRp7hurs5mnq6lXZy2s7jFq6CeppRjtbW5yw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
