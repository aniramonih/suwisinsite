Remembering theactor on what would have been his 44th birthday, Freddie explained how they first met during castings for the romantic comedy and how he helped Paul land the role. He told : "When Paul came into audition, I didn't have cast approval, but I had what they called consultation. I knew Paul was the right guy, and when he finished the audition, I asked if I could excuse myself to go to the bathroom."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/897eaa1fc976-paul-walker-z-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=ejdH77xG8FhBJ data-wc=12><strong>Freddie Prinze Jr has paid tribute to his late co-star Paul Walker</strong></p><p id=egHOy3XarUVGH data-wc=74>Freddie, who is married to <strong>Sarah Michelle Gellar</strong>, went on to reveal that he then chased Paul into the carpark. The 41-year-old shared: "I said, 'Hey man, you're going to get this job.' They didn't pay us anything. It was a small movie. [I said], 'They're going to offer you $25,000… Don't say no." Freddie took on the leading role of popular high school student Zack Siler, while Paul played his friend Dean Sampson.</p><p id=e4VO-xdQL8NLu><a class=hm-link href=#>WATCH: Vin Diesel sings emotional tribute to Paul Walker</a></p><p id=e6WHtf-YZYZl4 data-wc=85>"I heard, years later, after he passed away, that he had told his brother and his mum that story," added Freddie. "To hear that, that meant a lot to him to share that. I loved that there was still that connection there." Breaking down in tears, he remarked: "Excuse me for getting choked up, I don't normally... As an actor, you don't want guys to suffer if they don't have to. Right? You're like, 'Dude - you got the part!' He was a good dude."</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<p id=eBD9g-owLzwyW><a class=hm-link href=#>Paul Walker's daughter Meadow is all grown up!
