In a new social media post the actress shows off her amazing body in a bathing suit outfit. "Throwing it back to this bday look as I'm in the snow covered in jackets," she captioned the Instagram photos. "Beautiful," commented one of her followers. "You look stunningly gorgeous and sexy as always, Bella," added another. How does the young star stay fit? Here is everything we know about her diet and exercise routine.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Bella's trainer is a family member. "I wouldn't say I'm in my best shape at the moment. My brother is my trainer," she told </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Allure</span></a><span>. She added to </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Hollywood Life</span></a><span> that she and her family exercises together, calling fitness "a family affair."</span></p><p><span>Bella's workout is based on strength and weight training. "[My brother] has got me doing circuit training and weightlifting—I never do cardio. A lot of people think that cardio burns off weight better than weightlifting does…but weightlifting works your muscles, getting them toned while losing fat," she told Allure.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/01/shutterstock_557795095.jpg><p><span>Bella maintains that yoga is helpful in "helping her fall asleep easier at night," while also helping her feel like she "can do more in the day." </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Harvard Health</span></a><span> explains that yoga is a great workout, according to science. "Researchers found that people who practiced yoga for at least 30 minutes once a week for at least four years, gained less weight during middle adulthood," they said. "People who were overweight actually lost weight. Overall, those who practiced yoga had lower body mass indexes (BMIs) compared with those who did not practice yoga. Researchers attributed this to mindfulness. Mindful eating can lead to a more positive relationship with food and eating."</span></p><p><span>Bella fills her plate with veggies, fruit, protein, smoothies, and even rice and pasta. "Rice, black beans, pasta, fruit for my smoothies, veggies and some protein," are things you will find in her kitchen, she told </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Hollywood Life</span></a><span>. She added to </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Wired</span></a><span> that she also incorporates plant-based foods into her diet. "I'm not, I'm so sorry guys. I really want to be though," she said when asked </span><span>if she was a vegan, adding that she eats&nbsp; "a lot of vegan food but man, bacon. Oh, gets me every time."</span></p><p><span>Bella also does reformer pilates. "Getting back on that</span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span> #grind</span></a><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span> #pilates</span></a><span> and it feels good," she captioned a post. Why is pilates a good workout? According to the </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Mayo Clinic</span></a><span> there are lots of benefits to the workout, as it "strengthens the body's inner core while increasing its flexibility resulting in improved overall health. It can also promote longer, leaner muscles, injury prevention, relief from stress and back pain, enhanced athletic performance, and heightened mind-body awareness.</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;"I always stretch before my workout and after, to make the muscles grow longer and slimmer #workouttip #thirstythursday #thankfulthursday," Bella informed her followers in a post. "Stretching keeps the muscles flexible, strong, and healthy, and we need that flexibility to maintain a range of motion in the joints," says </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Harvard Health</span></a><span>. "Without it, the muscles shorten and become tight. Then, when you call on the muscles for activity, they are weak and unable to extend all the way. That puts you at risk for joint pain, strains, and muscle damage."</span></p><p><span>Bella also </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>enjoys </span></a><span>taking SoulCycle classes. The </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Cleveland Clinic </span></a><span>explains that biking, a low-impact aerobic exercise, is great for building muscle, improving strength and flexibility, and improving balance. It can also boost mental health and help other health conditions, including arthritis.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifKOxy6WYZqyYpL%2BvsYysn6ivo2K8p7KMraannZRiwba5zLJkoqZdqMSqudKuoK1lkpmuunnLqKakZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
