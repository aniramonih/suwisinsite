This is the face of a mother who just had the sh$t beaten out of her. A mother whose only thought was, ‚ÄòLet me run far enough and fight hard enough so that my kids have a chance to get away.'‚Äù</p><p>Despite the trauma, Sathanandan praised law enforcement for their swift response, but the suspects involved in the carjacking remain at large.</p><p>Shivanthi Sathanandan, an Asian American of Indian Sri Lankan descent and a graduate of St. Paul Central High School and the University of Minnesota, used her Facebook post to recount the harrowing experience and called on the police to hold criminals accountable. She stated, ‚ÄúLook at my face.

Critics pointed to a three-year-old Facebook post in which she advocated for dismantling the Minneapolis Police Department following the killing of George Floyd by an officer in 2020. In that post, she stated, ‚ÄúSay it with me. DISMANTLE The Minneapolis Police Department,‚Äù and argued that it had ‚Äúsystematically failed the Black Community,‚Äù calling for the creation of a new infrastructure that works for all communities.</p><p>The contrasting views expressed in these two posts have sparked a division among social media users, with some highlighting the perceived hypocrisy of the situation. One commenter remarked, ‚ÄúYou literally did everything in your power to dismantle the police. Now you‚Äôre reaping what you sowed.‚Äù Another sympathized with her ordeal but noted, ‚ÄúNo one should have this happen to them, children present or otherwise. Not ever. Nevertheless, HOW COULD Ms. Sathanandan NOT SEE THIS COMING, considering the efforts of her party? If you fight for a lawless state, lawlessness happens in broad daylight.‚Äù</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiin5fAo7vTrGWcp51kxKmt02afmqigmrumsIytpmarmJ7DorrToaBmq5GptaK6wKebmqZdmbOtec6fnaKbmZa5bq%2FAq6Gam5uasW61zWatoqecmru1ecinmqKclaPBbr%2FOnKCapF2isqW1wGapnqugpLu0sdJmm6Kulae0pns%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
