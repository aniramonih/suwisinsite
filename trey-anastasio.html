After performing one set, Michael Jackson’s Thriller album was put on by a party-goer to drown out the band. The band would not return to play but were still paid for the performance. At UVM, he hosted an early morning radio program, Ambient Alarm Clock. While living at home for a semester, he met up with childhood friends Tom Marshall, his future writing partner, and Marc Daubert who would officially join Phish as percussionist from September 1984 to February 1985. After seeing a Phish show, pianist Page McConnell joined Phish in the autumn of 1985.During this time he began a musical association and close friendship with composer Ernie Stires, who taught him composition, theory, and arranging.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>Trey Anastasio Wife</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>He is married to Susan Statesir, and they have two daughters, Eliza and Isabella</p><h2>Trey Anastasio&nbsp; Albums</h2><p>Studio albums</p><ul><li>One Man’s Trash ( October 27, 1998)</li><li>Trey Anastasio (April 30, 2002)</li><li>Seis De Mayo (April 6, 2004)</li><li>Shine (November 1, 2005)</li><li>Bar 17 (October 3, 2006)</li><li>The Horseshoe Curve (July 24, 2007)</li><li>Time Turns Elastic (May 12, 2009)</li><li>Traveler (October 16, 2012)</li><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><li>Paper Wheels (October 30, 2015)</li><li>Ghosts of the Forest (April 12, 2019)</li></ul><p>Live albums</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><ul><li>Plasma (April 29, 2003)</li><li>Original Boardwalk Style (June 10, 2008)</li><li>TAB at the TAB (September 14, 2010)</li></ul><p>Collaborations</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><ul><li>Surrender to the Air (with Surrender to the Air) (1996)</li><li>Trampled by Lambs and Pecked by the Dove (with Tom Marshall) (November 1, 2000)</li><li>The Grand Pecking Order (with Oysterhead) (October 2, 2001)</li><li>Fare Thee Well: Celebrating 50 Years of the Grateful Dead (with the Grateful Dead) (November 20, 2015)</li></ul><h2>Trey Anastasio Acoustic</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><h2>Trey Anastasio&nbsp; Shine</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><h2>Trey Anastasio Twitter</h2><p><a class=twitter-timeline data-width=500 data-height=750 data-dnt=true href=#>Tweets by treyanastasio</a></p><h2>Trey Anastasio Instagram</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><h2>Trey Anastasio Interview</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p><strong>Trey Anastasio Opens Up About His New Mystery Band, Ghosts of the Forest.</strong></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-913 data-method=placement-service></span><p><strong>Interviewer:It’s been a decade since you put a new band together. How did you know that these songs required a new group?<br></strong><strong>Trey :</strong>It was definitely not gonna be a new band or even a show. It was just personal songs that I was writing. And the big impetus was Fish [drummer Jon Fishman] and Tony [Markellis] were two of the first people I met when I moved to Burlington when I was 18, and I started a band with each of them. Tony was the foundation of TAB and Fish was the foundation of Phish, thus the name. But they had never played together. And they had been friends and circling — I think they had played maybe two songs together in 30 years. I thought it would be fun to call them and track the thing as a trio.</p><p>Not to convolute the story — but [before that] I had a TAB tour booked, but Ray had a brain tumor. It was very serious, and we were very scared. I can thankfully say that he’s 100 percent cured. We canceled the tour. By the time the studio dates came, there was a lot of emotion in the air. I had a bunch of songs. But it’s so raw and organic. We recorded in two days. I remember we were done, and [our manager] Patrick Jordan I remember being surprised. I called up Patrick and said, “We’re done.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span><p>My friend Chris, who a lot of those songs kind of allude to, passed away at the end of February. He was a nature lover. He loved the mountains. He always would take me hiking. One of the things that was sort of extra sad about the loss was that he was my friend outside of all this — a long-before, boyhood friend. When we were a young band and we would drive out to Colorado from somewhere overnight, he would always grab me and make me hike up the Flatirons, or go skiing, or go fly-fishing, which I sucked at. He would always take me out of the tour. It just dawned on me recently that he was sort of my tether to childhood and to a life before Phish happened — somebody that kind of understood who you could talk to that didn’t work with me.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-914 data-method=placement-service></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span><p><strong>Interviewer:When did you realize you were writing about Chris?<br></strong><strong>Trey :</strong>I try to stay in the present as much as possible, and I’m a big Eckhart Tolle fan. I read that stuff all the time, and also I play in a visceral, improvisational band. We don’t go onstage with a set list. My life is very much, you know, the next note.</p><p>So some of this stuff started and then when all of these events took place. Some of the music for “Drift While You Were Sleeping” was written, but I didn’t quite know what it was about. And then I went through this thing with Chris at the last stage of his life. I sat for days with him with my acoustic guitar. He sat on the couch and he kind of drifted in and out of consciousness. It was powerful and scary, and also kind of beautiful. It sort of became [about], “Well, we’re all going there, we’re all here together in death and in dreaming, and we’re free of time.” I was thinking about my sister who also died of cancer, and my grandmother. We carry these people around with us.</p><p><strong>Interviewer:One of the most emotional songs is “In Long Lines,” where you sing about loved ones who have left us “moving around us … in long lines.” Where did that idea come from?<br></strong><strong>Trey :</strong>Well, you know, maybe this is some kind of mid-life crisis on a record, I don’t know. My sister died. I had the same experience that so many of my friends have had, which is after she died — we were there when she drifted off — I had this sort of moment. It really was kind of powerful, where I kind of had my eyes closed and had a moment. She had been so sick for so long and then all of a sudden I saw her in my mind’s eye, vibrant and beautiful again, and I had forgotten that she had even looked like that. It was a glimpse and it went away and I never saw it again. But it comforted me. [It was] this idea that all these people are carried in our hearts and souls. This is so not profound, everybody thinks this, but I couldn’t shake it. Normally I’m so optimistic — everything’s fine. But this one just hit me. I was sad for a while.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-915 data-method=placement-service></span><p>“In Long Lines,” one of the funny things about Chris is he was kind of a mountain man, and he smoked. He smoked right up until he died. I kind of loved it, in a weird way. But one of the last things he did was go out on the porch and smoke a cigarette. And that was the kind of guy he was. That’s in the song, if you listen, you know: “I lit your cigarette.” I don’t recommend it for everyone who has cancer.</p><p><strong>Source:rollingstone.com</strong></p><h2>Trey Anastasio News</h2><p><strong>Listen to a New Trey Anastasio Song, “Ghosts of the Forest”</strong></p><p>Trey Anastasio has announced a new solo album,&nbsp;Ghosts of the Forest.
