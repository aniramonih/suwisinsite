The Love and Hip Hop Miami star and singer shared the news on her <a href=#>twins’ Instagram page</a> on Tuesday. “Meet Our Mommy Amara La Negra & Our Daddy Allan Mueses,” a caption reads under a photo of the couple.</p><p>Amara La Negra announced that she was expecting last year. She told People <a href=#>En Espanol at the time, </a>“In my case, I woke up pregnant like the Virgin Mary. I woke up pregnant and that’s all I remember,” she emphatically emphasized. “I’m going to be a single mother. I know my babies are going to depend on me.” And she added: “Father is not the one who begets, he is the one who breeds. At the time, if God gives me the blessing of finding the right man, who supports me, who accepts me with my children, well, well received. But I feel blessed and I am so happy that I even forget that [about being a single mother]. I am more focused on my babies.”</p><p>Amara has since maintained that she will be a single mother, but not by choice. She<a href=#> recently said</a>, “This is going to be the first time I am going to be completely honest. I think there was a part of me that was a little bit embarrassed to say that I am a single mother, not necessarily by choice. People can be very judgmental once you are in the public eye, and I just wasn’t ready to speak that truth.”</p><p>Adding, “I won’t necessarily say that I am at this moment, either, but I will say that it wasn’t something that I wanted, you know? My dream [growing up] as an only child was always to have a big family, to get married, and have a beautiful home and picnics on Sundays…and it didn’t turn out that way. I thought that I had chosen the right partner to make that happen but it wasn’t like that. So, I don’t have another option. But that’s OK. I’m a mother, my children are within me and I have to take that responsibility, and be that mother figure/father figure for my girls.”</p><p><span class="post-views-icon dashicons dashicons-chart-bar"></span><br><span class=post-views-label>Post Views:</span><br><span class=post-views-count>3,073</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Keo56aXZy2tMCOmqSaqpFiuaJ5zZ6eq5ldp7K3scClqmaZnKGur3nMrpysnaNitrR5x56pZqynnru0ecWaq6GdomQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
