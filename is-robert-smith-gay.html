In 1983, he was a member of the short-lived band The Glove.</p><p>Smith is known for the way he plays the guitar, his unique voice, and the way he dresses. His style, which included pale skin, smeared red lipstick, black eyeliner, a tangled mess of black hair, and all-black clothes, had a big impact on the 1980s goth subculture.</p><p>As a member of the Cure, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2019. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Rolling Stone</a> magazine named him as the 157th best singer of all time in its 2023 list.</p><p>When the band was very famous in France and the United States, people used to think that Robert Smith is gay because the band was so odd compared to others.</p><p>So is Robert Smith really gay? Or these rumors are just baseless? Let’s not waste time and dive straight into the article to find out the truth about Robert Smith’s sexuality.</p><h2>Is Robert Smith Gay?</h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.therconline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/simon-gallup-robert-smith-the-cure-1989.jpg alt="is robert smith gay" width=2000 height=1270 sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>No, Robert Smith is not gay.</strong> He is often mistaken for being gay due to a long-standing rumor that he is in a relationship with his fellow bandmate, Simon Gallup. However, it is important to clarify that Robert Smith is not gay.</p><p>In a revealing <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview with SPIN</a> in 1987, when asked about the assumption, Robert expressed genuine surprise and responded, “All Americans seem to think you’re gay, Robert. ‘Do they?’ he says, faintly but genuinely surprised:</p><p>‘That’s because no one ever sees Mary. We’ve been going together for 13 years—13 years of gayness! She hates having her photograph taken. She hates being associated with me.'”</p><p>This statement serves as clear evidence of Robert Smith’s heterosexuality and his long-standing romantic relationship with Mary, debunking any misconceptions about his sexual orientation.</p><p>It is crucial to respect and acknowledge the truth in order to dispel unfounded assumptions and provide an accurate representation of an individual’s personal life.</p><p><strong>Also Read:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Is Fetty Wap Gay?

They don’t have any kids.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Contactmusic</a>, Smith said he didn’t want children because he doesn’t like being alive and doesn’t want to make someone else live. Smith also says, “I don’t feel like I’m responsible enough to bring a child into the world.” Smith and Poole have a total of 25 nephews and nieces.</p><p>Smith later said that when he first started out in music, Mary didn’t always share his faith and vision for the Cure’s future. This was a big reason why he worked so hard to make sure the band was successful.</p><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The Daily Express</a> said that Mary used to be a model and work as a nurse for children with learning disabilities. However, when the Cure started making more money in the mid-1980s, Mary quit her day job so that she and Robert didn’t have to be apart as much.</p><p>Smith told The Face that he had once left a video camera going in their home. “After a couple of hours, you forget it’s on, and I was shocked by how much trash we say to each other,” he said.</p><p>It’s like hearing crazy people… I feel more at ease when I’m with people who don’t have their heads on straight&nbsp;because you’re always on the lookout for what they’re going to do next…”</p><p>He said that Mary “used to dress up as a witch to scare little children,” that she sometimes dressed up as Robert Smith in his pajamas&nbsp;and that he could never take people home because “I never knew who was going to answer the door.”</p><p><strong>Must Read:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Is Peet Montzingo Gay?

One of the things that were pinned to the wall was a chart called “Mary’s Manor Mad Chart,” which put seventeen people, including the Cure and their crew, “in order of instability.”</p><p>After a woman who worked in the kitchen called Louise, Mary came in second. Smith said, “We all voted, and we had an awards night. It made me cry.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq5qoppyeu6Z6wqikaJuVobKjvsitsGiho2K%2FsK7Eq6tmq52ewal5xpqwaGpobH5xew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
