Nevermind yes catapaulted the band to stardom knocking Michael Jackson off No. 1 and had possibly the anthem of the 90s (Smells Like Teen Spirit) and had some really good songs (Come As You Are, In Bloom, Polly etc)"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Nirvana had quality music up until the point they had disbanded. This isn't your run-of-the-mill local band who plays suck-ish covers of Guns N' Roses songs. We're talking about Nirvana, a band who put out quality music. Nirvana put out more quality music than any other grunge band, which is a hard fact to argue. That makes them better already, so the debate should technically end there. If you're the best in genre at what you do, it's kind of hard to overrate them. You can't really put them any higher.<p>Yes he was a lyrical genius. But so were Layne Staley and Jerry Cantrell (Alice In Chains) Eddie Vedder (Pearl Jam) and Chris Cornell (Soundgarden)</p><p>This could be argued as well, but you can ask any kid that grew up as a part of Generation X, in the early and mid 90's, or even college kids that grew up after that, or people like me that were too young to experience the music as it happened. If you ask them about Nirvana, they will more than likely tell you that their lyrics had a huge influence upon them, much more than any other band. Kurt Cobain was the voice of a generation with his lyrics, and you cannot honestly dispute that. All you can say is that Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Alice in Chains, and Pearl Jam did the same. But they really didn't. They had close to the same lifespan (well, some of them) and they made the same kind of music, but Nirvana had them beat as the band that spoke to people. The influence they had is undeniable and indisputable, and it may be the single biggest influence a band had on someone since The Beatles, Rolling Stones, The Doors, Elvis and Led Zeppelin were around in the 60's and 70's. That alone puts them on the pedestal they are on, it puts them on that higher plateau. They made the same music as those other bands at the same time, but they did it better and spoke to more people on a wider level. Being overrated is praising someone or something more than it deserves, and with a band that had more influence than anyone since Elvis and Lennon, and made music that was widely celebrated <i>before</i> the singer died (which is why they are generally considered overrated, much like The Doors with Morrison) cannot be overrated.</p><p>His singing wasn't great in all honesty, his best performance was the Unplugged session in my opinion. And he wasn't that great of a frontman (but to be fair none of the grunge singers were that good)</p><p>Yes he conveyed emotion very well and I guess his style of singing helped that, but again the singers I've already mentioned could convey emotion just as well with an arguably better singing voice.</p><br>You can try and say this, but Cobain's range of emotion is untouched on songs such as "Rape Me" and "You Know You're Right" and with music that touched an entire generation like Nirvana did it is pretty hard to say that other singers conveyed the same amount of emotion. Yes and No. Soundgarden had been releasing recordings before Nirvana as well as Mudhoney (who were actually being touted as the big thing out of Seattle) and Alice In Chains' debut Facelift was the first grunge album to go platinum in the USA before Nevermind had been released.<p>After Nevermind there was lots of interest in the grunge bands, so people were checking the other ones out, so in a way they made some people check out the grunge bands that they probably wouldn't have.</p><br>Before Nirvana went national, no one gave a second thought to the Seattle noise. Before Kurt Cobain and Nirvana rose out of Aberdeen, the only thing that ever came from anywhere near Seattle that anybody cared about Heroin. Then with Nevermind, people cared. And not only did they care, they were influenced. The music spoke to them. Sure, they checked out and even enjoyed other grunge, but if it had spoke to them the way Nirvana did then we would be having this discussion about Soundgarden, Alice in Chains, or Mudhoney right now.<p>So in a roundabout way you're saying they are overrated a bit???</p><br>I'm saying that I can see where the argument would come from, yes, but the argument is mute in the end.<p>I'll argue that it was really luck moreso than anything that gave Nirvana the edge over their contemporaries. Nirvana and Mudhoney were both on Sub Pop and Mudhoney were more popular, if Mudhoney was the one that Geffen had signed we might be having a thread wondering if Mark Arm and Mudhoney are overrated.</p><br>Don't you think there was a reason why Nirvana was more popular though? <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/forums.wrestlezone.com/data:image/gif;base64 alt=;) title="Wink ;)" data-shortname=;) style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> And don't use that bull about Cobain being dead, because both bands had all members alive and making music at this point.<p>To be quite frank, with as much heat as Nirvana gets whenever I bring them up I would venture to say that they are underrated, because due to all the heat Cobain gets for becoming famous because he shot himself, people don't give Nirvana the props they deserve for the major influence on the music industry, the way they spoke to a generation, and the quality music they put out. Some people might not like it, unlike you and I, it might not be their style, but it is still quality music in any case.</p><p>Hell, if I were to venture to say any grunge band is overrated, it would be Pearl Jam. Mudhoney, Soundgarden, and other smaller grunge bands are never really recognized, there is always a big three discussed: Pearl Jam, Nirvana, and Alice in Chains. AIC is just a few steps below Nirvana, and always put out quality music and had a good-sized influenced themselves. Nowhere near Nirvana, but it is there. Pearl Jam didn't have the influence either had, their music really wasn't that great, and they are overall a much weaker band than the others. We should be having this discussion about Pearl Jam more so than any other grunge band. But that is a different story for a different day, and not the point here.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmien6fCrr%2BNsKmeq6Shsru7zZ5lnKedZMGpvsSam6xnmKTEbrvVnqmrmaSasW610mairqqkYrCwrsCipWaZnpl6r7XRr5inmV5mhHZ%2BmHFm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
