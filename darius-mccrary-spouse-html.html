Vann in 2005, but their union was&nbsp;short-lived, as they called it&nbsp;quits a year later in 2006. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>McCrary went on to say his wedding vows for a second time in 2009, this time with American author&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>Karrine Steffans</a>. Unfortunately, his second marriage didn't last either, and they divorced two years later, in 2011. <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><p>In 2014, he married for the third time, as he tied the knot with the former&nbsp;basketball athlete&nbsp;Tammy Brawner. But, unfortunately, things weren't different this time either. The former couple eventually separated in 2017.</p><h2>His Second Spouse&nbsp;Accused Him of Violent Physical Abuse</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>According to statements made by&nbsp;McCrary's ex-partners, the actor was a very aggressive and short-tempered man. For instance,&nbsp;his second spouse Steffans <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">filed a complaint</a> against him in 2010, stating he&nbsp;choked her and beat her with a belt during an argument in February that year. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Later in November, he again attacked her. He choked her and subsequently shoved her into a car in front of a large crowd&nbsp;at the Sunset Marquis Hotel in L.A.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Filing the complaint, she asked the judge to pass a permanent&nbsp;restraining order. However,&nbsp;McCrary was only arrested for a brief time and&nbsp;temporarily ordered to stay at least 100 yards away from her. The two eventually separated after those series of events.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>Violent, Destructive, and Emotionally Unstable during the Third Marriage</h2><p>The Family Matters&nbsp;star's third marriage didn't end on a good note, either. According to his <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">court documents</a>&nbsp;filed by his third spouse,&nbsp;she claimed the actor was&nbsp;violent,&nbsp;destructive, and emotionally unstable while adding he also had&nbsp;a drinking problem. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Brawner first came out with the allegations in 2017, claiming McCrary&nbsp;held their little daughter Zoey over a stove and pot of boiling water. After the incident, the basketball pro also filed for divorce in March 2017.</p><p>A year later, she added new details to the case, saying he had grabbed their daughter's arm to&nbsp;pull her into the bathroom, which led to the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">dislocation of the baby's arm</a>. Meanwhile, the actor denied the allegations and claimed&nbsp;in the court documents that he "grabbed one hand to lift her up and immediately grabbed the other."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>However, in&nbsp;Brawner's documents, she attached a copy of the medical reports that claimed that their daughter "cried when attempting to move the arm." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The medical report also stated that Zoey was&nbsp;diagnosed with a nursemaid's elbow,&nbsp;a common elbow injury in young children that occurs when a child's elbow is pulled, and a bone partially dislocates.</p><p>The former basketball star further said that she could not parent her daughter alone and expected help from her ex-husband. But according to her, the actor was not coordinating with her nicely and "appears to be too bitter and too much of a tyrant to parent with me."</p><p>Now, with the facts stated by his former spouses and approved by the court, it can be understood why his marriages never worked.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJyRp7a2v4ymmpyqkafGbr%2FPqKysnV6dwa64</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
