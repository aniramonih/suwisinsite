Though the “9 to 5” singer told Vogue in October 2020 that she’s “never thought of herself as fashionable,” she has stunned in a variety of glamorous ensembles through the years."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Fringe! Mini dresses! <a href=#><strong>Dolly Parton</strong></a> is as much a fashion icon as she is a music legend.</p><p>The “Just Because I’m a Woman” singer has never been one to shy away making a style statement on the red carpet and beyond. From sizzling getups to figure hugging ensembles — she’s slayed it all.</p><p>Though the “9 to 5” singer told <a href=#>Vogue</a> in October 2020 that she’s “never thought of herself as fashionable,” she has stunned in a variety of glamorous ensembles through the years. Whether she’s signing CDs at Best Buy or attending one of the first-ever<a href=#> Vanity Fair Oscar parties</a>, fans can expect her to dress to impress.</p><p>For instance, in 1984, the “Jolene” singer attended the New York City premiere of Rhinestone alongside her co-star <a href=#><strong>Sylvester Stallone</strong></a>. For the sleek affair, she dazzled in a beautiful white off-the-shoulder gown with lovely embroidery. “I remember thinking I have to look good because Stallone was hotter than Dooley at that time,” she told <a href=#>Vogue</a> in October 2020. “So I tried to look my Dolly best!”</p><p>In a 2019 interview with Vogue, the blonde beauty joked, “I always joke that I never leave a rhinestone unturned,” She continued, “I have to have sparkles on my clothes. It makes me feel vibrant. Shoot, even my pajamas have rhinestones on them!”</p><p>It’s not just fashion that the “<a href=#>My Tennessee Mountain Home” singer</a> goes all-out with — Parton also favors incredibly bouncy hairstyles and lots of makeup. “I know that I always like to wear a lot of makeup. More than probably I should wear,” she said during a 2020 interview with <a href=#>Vogue</a>. “But I think more is more, and whoever made up that ‘less is more’ is full of it!”</p><p>One of the “I Will Always Love You” singer’s most memorable looks was her ensemble to the <a href=#>2022 Academy of Country Music Awards</a>. For the soirée, she donned four different outfits — and each one was just as magnificent as the other.</p><p>The Tennessee native arrived at the awards ceremony in a gold and black number complete with a fringe skirt and sleeves. She styled her strands in a <a href=#>voluminous updo and added a butterfly clip at her crown</a>. For her second look, she changed into a reflective jumpsuit. The figure-hugging number featured a shattered glass design and rhinestones. The “Island In The Stream” singer added silver platform heels to complete the number.</p><p>Next, the “Two Doors Down” singer went back to her country roots and <a href=#>sported a cowgirl hat, yellow V-neck and blue jeans</a> while strumming her guitar on stage. Finally, the “Wildflowers” singer changed into a midi golden dress to end the night and sported champagne-colored pumps.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The hitmaker has an unforgettable sense of fashion, and we’re taking a look back at her most memorable moments on the red carpet.</p><p>Keep scrolling to see Parton’s glitziest, most glamorous red carpet looks of all time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6poJyspaeytHvDqKOlsV2lrrPAzqeqZpqVqMFuvsSdZJyZoqWytXnFmqqhoZ%2Bjeq67zJ6lratdpbakv44%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
