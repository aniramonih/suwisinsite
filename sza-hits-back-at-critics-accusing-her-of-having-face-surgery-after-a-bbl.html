You would rather believe any Twitter thread; you could just google yourself and figure out,” SZA said.&nbsp;</p><p>She continued, “There’s clear instances when I talk about my freckles… I hear crazy s–t about myself. I heard I had a facelift, I heard I had a nose job, I heard my teeth were fake. Now do I need to go out and get a nose job because you all made me feel like I need one?”&nbsp;</p><p>Her conversation was shared on The Neighborhood Talk’s Instagram page, <a href=#>where</a> many commenters pinpointed how drastically different SZA’s facial features look to them. One person wrote, “Now Sza… that nose definitely been reworked.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>cmon <a href=#>https://t.co/CL7D3Fyyhy</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/x3wjGuJgWj</a></p>— rxmsxy (@rxmsxy) <a href=#>October 30, 2023</a></figure><p>A second individual wrote, “Now SZA! You know a chin doesn’t grow 3 inches! You have had SO much work done it’s ridiculous.”</p><p>A few SZA fans credited her ability to perfectly contour and blend her makeup as the reason why she doesn’t look the same. A few of those comments included, “Teeth looks the same to me. But weight loss and makeup can do wonders. Speaking from experience,” and “She just got good makeup.”&nbsp;</p><p>It can be inferred that the reason why fans are finding it so hard to believe that SZA didn’t nip or tuck her face is because of the long-running claims that describe her as a pathological liar. The “Snooze” artist also decided to address that reputation in her interview.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>The fanmade theory suggesting that the “Open Arms” songstress lies for fun began sparking after internet investigators found contradictions in various statements of SZA’s, such as she’s never had a birthday cake before.&nbsp;</p><p>While the popular fan thesis was initially created for laughs, the 33-year-old revealed that she doesn’t find the accusations amusing but rather the opposite. “That s–t is lowkey offensive,” SZA shared.&nbsp;</p><p>“Not low-key, it’s high-key offensive. But what am I supposed to do? Post a dubinking thread? That’s crazy,” she added.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Never miss a story — sign up for&nbsp;ATLANTA BLACK STAR’S free daily newsletters&nbsp;to stay up-to-date on the latest developments from top news headlines to celebrity news.</strong></a></p><p>SZA’s name was previously in the media after critics deemed her as “insecure” for going under the knife.&nbsp;Though speculations about her receiving plastic surgery have been in the air for years, she never confirmed getting her “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">body done</a>” until the release of her 2022 sophomore album “SOS.”</p><p>Several songs on the album, such as the self-titled track and the song title “Conceited” feature her admitting that her curvaceous figure was sculpted by the hands of a surgeon.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKGur8DAm6Oam5uowaK%2BjZympmdiZX90e5BpZmxpX6jHonnHoqusZZKWsKx5wK1knKqZqbakv4yampyto567qHnHnqlmp5ZitaLCyKeeZp6RmLJuv9Srnp6qqWKup8DEq2SaZZKXuXA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
