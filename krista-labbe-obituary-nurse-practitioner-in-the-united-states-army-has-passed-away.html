(Pazdernik) Labbe, 42, of Liberty Hill, Texas, died suddenly on October 23, 2023. Krista Pazdernkik was born in Alexandria, Minnesota, to Tonya and Irvan in 1981. Michael, Jamie, and her sister are her siblings. She may have been called a tomboy since she played and competed with her brothers as a child. She attended adjacent dance classes and soccer games while not with her boys. She worked hard and took on three jobs to save for her amazing gown. She got an ROTC scholarship for her intelligence. She also had great athleticism and received a second scholarship after trying out for her school’s soccer team.</p><p>Krista married Jamahl E. Labbe in Ashville, North Carolina, on December 28, 2010. Despite difficult Army missions, they built a loving and caring family. Krista joined the US Army Nurse Corps after graduating from Viterbo University with a nursing degree. Her twenty-year service in Afghanistan earned her a Lieutenant Colonel rank. The early assignment to Labor and Delivery sparked her interest in the field. She joined the University of Utah Midwifery Doctorate of Nursing Specialty Program to pursue her aspirations. She became a midwife, or Women’s Health Nurse Practitioner, after graduating.</p><p>Krista’s universe revolved on her three children, Paul, Harper, and Adison. Nothing made her happier than establishing new memories with loved ones. Krista had a lifelong, growing connection with God. Beck Funeral Home, 1700 E. Whitestone Blvd., Cedar Park, will have a funeral ceremony for her on Friday, November 3rd, at 10:00 a.m. Visitors can arrive at 9 a.m. Please donate to Krista’s Project Overwatch, where she coordinated, instead of flowers. Krista is our cherished wife, mother, and leader. Many others considered her a daughter, little sister, friend, colleague, and mentor. Our hearts ache over her death. We invite family and friends to celebrate her life.</p>0<span class=mashsb-sharetext>SHARES</span><a class="mashicon-facebook mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Share</span></a><a class="mashicon-twitter mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Tweet</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmihnqG8t7XNoKSepZ%2Bntqa%2FzZ6urGaTpLpwt9Giqq2ZXaGuo67EZqaboaSqrrPFjKesq6uVYr2zrcKtoK2hn6Oys3nIp2StoJViwq%2B1056bZquklsGmv4yaqaaxXZ2utHnPmqqsnZRirrit2Gg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
