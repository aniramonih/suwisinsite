Source: Avalanche StudiosJ.K. Rowling has made numerous public anti-trans comments, and while she was not directly involved in the creation of Hogwarts Legacy, she is still likely to profit from the title.
Within its opening week, Hogwarts Legacy has spurred waves of controversy regarding its transgender character and currently sits in the eye of a boycott through various means."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Congratulations, the game was definitely worth the wait. But could we have a new game plus mode?

For example, <a href=#>Elden Ring</a> players could restart the game and continue leveling their character, but enemies will have increased strength each time that players restart.</p><p>Developer Avalanche Studios has not confirmed if Hogwarts Legacy will get a similar New Game Plus Mode or something vastly different.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Could a New Game Plus Mode get added in 'Hogwarts Legacy' later?</h2><p>It's possible that Avalanche could add a New Game Plus Mode in Hogwarts Legacy later, but players probably won't see one until months after its initial Feb. 10 launch.</p><p>The same situation happened for <a href=#>God of War</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Callisto Protocol</a> — both adding the option weeks after release.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>loving the game just wish it was longer with more quest have to force myself not to play it so much as I know I'll 100% it to fast there's no new game plus so unfortunately can see the game dying out after completing hope you will add some DLCs and maybe some PVP</p>— steven fuller (@stevenfuller194) <a href=#>February 9, 2023</a> <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Avalanche Studios via Twitter</a></figure><p>Those additional weeks would likely give Avalanche time to scale specific enemies to match players with a robust build and maybe introduce new mechanics to bosses to make the experience more challenging.</p><p>Regardless, we'll have to wait and see what Avalanche decides next for the game.</p><p><strong>If you or someone you know is a member of the transgender community and in need of support, call the Trevor Project's 24/7/365 Lifeline at 866-4-U-TREVOR.
