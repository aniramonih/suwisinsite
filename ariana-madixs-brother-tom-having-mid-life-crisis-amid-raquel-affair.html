Ariana Madix’s brother, Jeremy Madix, is weighing in on her split from Tom Sandoval and his cheating scandal with Raquel Leviss.
“It’s funny to watch people social climb and be soooooooo fake that they’re willing to s—t on people that are supposed to be their ‘best friend’ (a term that gets thrown around very often around here) all just to come up or have some sort of story line,” the Madix cofounder, 30, commented via Instagram on Friday, March 3, on James Kennedy’s post that shared the news of his sibling’s breakup."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Sell out type lame s—t. Let’s all remember that Raquel was a fan of the show before all of this. Does anyone pay attention?”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Ariana-Madixs-Brother-Jeremy-Speaks-Out-Amid-Tom-Sandoval-Split-0001.jpg><p>The model’s brother wasn’t the only one who stood by Ariana, who <a href=#>deleted her social media accounts</a> once the news broke. Her costar <a href=#><strong>Lala Kent</strong></a> <a href=#>spoke out against Sandoval</a> via her Instagram Stories.</p><p>“Yeah. I’m the ‘overly douchey’ one. Okay,” the Give Them Lala Beauty founder, 32, wrote on Friday alongside a headline that reads, “Tom Sandoval on feuding with overly douchey Lala Kent: I don’t think she’s real.”</p><p>She continued: “Oh Sandoval … Your problem with me is I’m a little too real for your comfort,” Kent wrote. “I’ve seen you for who you are for a long time, and you don’t like that. But, I think now is the time for you to shut the f—k up. I’m eatin good the next time I see you.”</p><p>The <a href=#>former couple began dating</a> during the second season of the <a href=#>Bravo reality series</a>. The TomTom co-owner, for his part, was in a relationship with <a href=#><strong>Kristen Doute</strong></a> in the inaugural season of the show. Despite having <a href=#>a rocky relationship</a> with the former pair, Doute shared on Friday she was “Team Ariana 25/8,” after learning about the scandal.</p><p>Leviss, for her part, didn’t join the cast until the fifth season. She was <a href=#>previously engaged</a> to Kennedy, 31, <a href=#>before they split</a> in 2021. (Sandoval actually helped the DJ with the costs of the elegant proposal, which took place seven months <a href=#>before their breakup</a>.)</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Hope you all feel as sick as I do. This explains everything,” Kennedy <a href=#>reacted to the news of his ex and pal</a> via Instagram on Friday.</p><p>Leviss has found herself in <a href=#>hot water as of late</a>. She also made headlines after she was seen making out with <a href=#><strong>Tom Schwartz</strong></a> amid his divorce from <a href=#><strong>Katie Maloney</strong></a> in August 2022, which is currently playing out on <a href=#>season 10 of the show</a>. On Friday, Maloney, 36, reacted to Sandoval and Raquel’s scandal with two clown emojis on social media.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaaqpmWu6J5zJqborCjYq%2Bzu9OhnKtlpKS6brTAr6Cnn12itqV5y6KdnmWTp7a0tdJmmKahlGK%2For3UnqNmmZabrqq%2Bjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
