Former acting CIA Director Michael Morell told fellow former CIA boss John Brennan in an Oct. 19, 2020, email — obtained by Just the News — that he was attempting to give Biden’s 2020 presidential campaign some ammunition to “push back on Trump” during the debate as he urged Brennan to sign on to the letter calling Hunter Biden’s laptop a possible Russian disinformation operation."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Good initiative. Thanks for asking me to sign on.”&nbsp;</p><p>The smoking-gun email exchange shows that Brennan knew Morell’s political motivation before he signed on to the letter.&nbsp;</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Former Deputy CIA Director Michael Morell is sworn in prior to testimony before the House Select Intelligence Committee on April 2, 2014, in Washington, DC. <span class=credit>Getty Images</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Former CIA Director John Brennan participates in a session at the third annual Intelligence and National Security Summit in Washington, on Sept. 8, 2016. <span class=credit>REUTERS</span></figure><p>The Post learned on Thursday that Brennan <a href=#>will sit with members of the House subcommittee </a>on the weaponization of the federal government for a transcribed interview related to the letter on May 11.</p><p>Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, who also signed on to the letter, will appear for an interview before the panel on May 17, a source familiar with the plans told The Post.&nbsp;</p><p>Morell’s email also sheds light on other members of the US intelligence community who were asked to add their name to the project but didn’t.&nbsp;</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">President Biden and Hunter Biden leave Holy Spirit Catholic Church in Johns Island, South Carolina, after attending Mass on Aug. 13, 2022. <span class=credit>AP</span></figure><p>“Will be adding Leon, Sue Gordon, Jeh Johnson, George, Lisa Monaco, and Mike Rogers (DIRNSA) today.
