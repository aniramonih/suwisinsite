Even after spending 17 years as a couple, the duo still finds new things about each other and makes enough time for each other. And as far as Hunnam is concerned, it’s not the grand gestures that keep the love alive but rather the small things they do every day. Even though both are well-known actors or at least Hunnam is, they get enough time to surprise each other and that has been the core of their relationship for all these years. But unlike Hunnam’s fame, McNelis is not known for her roles in movies and is barely mentioned for her body of work. So, for this article, we will take a closer look at the wiki-bio of Morgan McNelis.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Early Life:</h2><p>Morgana McNelis was born on the 7th of September 1983, in Georgia, United States. Born and raised in Georgia, McNelis spent most of her early life with her younger sister, Marina Milori. As a young kid, Morgana developed a strong appreciation for aesthetics and got into jewelry designing at a very young age. After graduation from high school, McNelis began attending regular jewelry crafting lessons. She continued her education and enrolled at the William Holland School of Lapidary Arts at 20 years of age.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/thecelebsinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Charlie-Hunnam-and-Morgana-McNelis.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Professional Career:</h2><p>During her years at William Holland, McNelis took different courses on fashion, art, and business administration. Following her exit in 2007, she started a jewelry store alongside her sister. However, McNelis chose the wrong time to start the shop and was plagued by the Great Recession in 2009. Ultimately, McNelis was forced to close shop and decided to try her luck as a model.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2011, McNelis found work as a costume assistant for the thriller movie, Isolation. Later that year, McNelis made her debut on-screen as an actress and off-screen as the producer, after she took on both roles in the horror movie, 187: The McKenna Murders.</p><p>McNelsi returned to the jewelry business in 2012 and came up with a unique jewelry line entitled,&nbsp; Maison de Morgana, located in Los Angeles, California. Her first collection, Black Magik was released in 2012 and was inspired by mythological stories of King Arthur and Dracula, ancient Egypt, and the Ottoman Empire. Her unique and celebratory pieces quickly made rounds of Hollywood, and McNelis was contacted by the executive directors of the TV series, Sons of Anarchy. They wanted to feature McNelis’s jewelry in the series.</p><p>McNelis never stopped from that point on and in 2014, released the BC Armor Collection for the Boot Campaign charitable organization.&nbsp;</p><p>While McNelis did have a short appearance on-screen in 2014, for the movie Acting 101, she continued her work on Jewelry designing and has expanded her business globally.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Personal life:</h2><p>Morgana McNelis is happily engaged to her fiance, Charlie Hunnam. The pair first met sometime around 2005. The pair have never revealed the exact date of how and where they met, but given their work, it is entirely possible to have run into each other during work. The pair announced their relationship in 2014 and got engaged in 2016. While they are yet to tie the knot or have any kids, both seem to be on the way. Talking about how the pair have made it over the years, in an interview Hunnam <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">shared</a>;</p><p>“I [Charlie Hunnam] try to keep the romance on the reg. I’ve been with my girlfriend 11 years, and as anyone knows, it’s been a long-term, fully monogamous relationship that requires work, a lot of work.”</p><p>And <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">according </a>to McNeils,</p><p>“I think the key to maintaining a good balance is creating a safe space within the relationship for both partners in which to grow and evolve. It’s very important to be present and participate in each other’s experiences so that falling in love doesn’t happen just once, it continues to happen over and over.”</p><p>However, this is not the first time Charlie has made steps toward a marriage commitment. Previously he was married to actress Katharine Towne from 1999-2002. As for McNelis, there is no information on her prior affairs, and considering how she likes to keep her personal life affair under wraps the information will be hard to come by.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Social Media and public appeareances:</h2><p>It is common for celebrity couples to go for public displays of affection and while PDA is also used for publicity stunts, The Sons of Anarchy star and his longtime partner McNeils have handled their relationship in a different way. The pair are rarely seen on public outings or Hollywood events. Also, the pair do not use social media which is often seen as an extra source of income for celebrities. Also, the pair has shown a preference for country life as they own a ranch outside of Hollywood where they have raised chickens, ducks, donkeys, and an organic garden.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>A quick write on Charlie Hunnam:</h2><p>Charlie Hunnam is an English actor and writer, known for his roles in popular TV shows and movies.
