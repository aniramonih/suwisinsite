A walk is a sensorial journey with the smell of sardines in the street, the ramble of pink bougainvillea, balconies of washing in a cacophony of colour, flapping in the wind.</p><p>But as the hotel boom continues visitors are being pulled inside, not only to the tile-clad churches, the excellent museums and the tempting restaurants, but also to the increasingly excellent spas. Here, legs aching from the cobbled pavements can be massaged with the region’s almond oil, treatments drawing on the local sea salt and citruses for scrubs invigorate, and facials into which are woven antioxidants straight from Portugal’s velvety red wines bring a healthy rather than alcoholic glow to every face. For a soothing stay in this dreamy city, here's our pick of the best spa hotels in Lisbon.</p><a href=# data-tmg-dtm-nav=image></a>This landmark hotel was built in 1959 by the dictator, António de Oliveira Salazar, to prove that Lisbon could do luxury as well as any other European capital. More than half a century later it is still setting the bar. The spa is undoubtedly the best in the city, with an 18-metre lap pool as its centrepiece. Products are from Sodashi, Swiss Perfection and ESPA; manicures use Spa Ritual’s vegan nail care products. Four rooms offer treatments such as honey and almond scrub, the four-handed 'Symphony massage', and facials from Swiss Perfection, which deliver effective anti-ageing treatments. Of the 282 rooms and four luxury suites, all but 10 have private terraces with far-reaching views over Lisbon. <span class="link-wrapper travel-product-card__review-link" data-ampclass=link-wrapper><a class=link data-ampclass=link href=#>Read expert review</a></span> <span class="travel-price__prefix e-price__heading" data-ampclass=travel-price__prefix>From</span> <span class="travel-price__wrap e-price__wrapper" data-ampclass=travel-price__wrap><span class="travel-price__symbol e-price__currency" data-ampclass=travel-price__symbol itemprop=currenciesAccepted content="GBP">£</span> <span class="travel-price__price e-price__fee" data-ampclass=travel-price__price>670</span></span><p>• <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">An insider guide to Lisbon</a></p><a href=# data-tmg-dtm-nav=image></a>This seductive hotel lies on the banks of the Tagus River and offers sleek, minimalist interiors and the Michelin-starred Restaurant Feitoria. Decorative artefacts lend a sense of heritage, as do the views over the 16th-century Tower of Belem, from where the great navigators set sail. The B Spa by Karin Herzog is excellent with Oxygen Spa therapy treatments, hammam, indoor pool, Turkish bath, Vichy shower rooms and experience showers. It's located in the suburb of Belém, four miles from the city centre and home to the magnificent Jerónimos Monastery. It is also the birthplace of Lisbon’s famous custard tarts. <span class="link-wrapper travel-product-card__review-link" data-ampclass=link-wrapper><a class=link data-ampclass=link href=#>Read expert review</a></span> <span class="travel-price__prefix e-price__heading" data-ampclass=travel-price__prefix>From</span> <span class="travel-price__wrap e-price__wrapper" data-ampclass=travel-price__wrap><span class="travel-price__symbol e-price__currency" data-ampclass=travel-price__symbol itemprop=currenciesAccepted content="GBP">£</span> <span class="travel-price__price e-price__fee" data-ampclass=travel-price__price>238</span></span><p>• The&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">best five-star hotels in Lisbon</a></p><a href=# data-tmg-dtm-nav=image></a>Epic Sana is centrally located and offers 311 dazzlingly modern bedrooms, a Portuguese surf 'n' turf restaurant, and a heated rooftop infinity pool with surrounding cabanas from which to watch the sun set over the Tagus River.

It was built in 1933 and was completely re-designed by acclaimed architect Pardal Monteiro in the 1950s. Today it offers 285 rooms and the sleek, go-to rooftop Sky Bar, as well as an attractive spa, adjoining the fitness centre, where a wide range of treatments are available including facials with French skincare brand Biologique Recherche. Massages can also be organised in the cabanas above the beautiful swimming pool, hidden in a garden of century-old botanical trees, which has the feel of a jungle paradise. <span class="link-wrapper travel-product-card__review-link" data-ampclass=link-wrapper><a class=link data-ampclass=link href=#>Read expert review</a></span> <span class="travel-price__prefix e-price__heading" data-ampclass=travel-price__prefix>From</span> <span class="travel-price__wrap e-price__wrapper" data-ampclass=travel-price__wrap><span class="travel-price__symbol e-price__currency" data-ampclass=travel-price__symbol itemprop=currenciesAccepted content="GBP">£</span> <span class="travel-price__price e-price__fee" data-ampclass=travel-price__price>249</span></span><p>• The&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">best restaurants in Lisbon</a></p><a href=# data-tmg-dtm-nav=image></a>Santiago de Alfama is located in the oldest part of Lisbon and has wonderful views over the capital's red roofs. Its 19 rooms are all different whilst celebrating the best of Portugal, from the modern art on the walls to the Claus Porto soaps in the bathrooms, while an atmospheric café serving Portuguese pastries and plates of local hams and cheeses spills out onto the cobbled street. In the basement you'll find the Beauty Bar, which offers facial and body treatments, massages, beautification sessions for both hand and foot ('manly' versions also available), eyebrow tidying and hair styling, with a cocktail or two to lubricate proceedings. <span class="link-wrapper travel-product-card__review-link" data-ampclass=link-wrapper><a class=link data-ampclass=link href=#>Read expert review</a></span> <span class="travel-price__prefix e-price__heading" data-ampclass=travel-price__prefix>From</span> <span class="travel-price__wrap e-price__wrapper" data-ampclass=travel-price__wrap><span class="travel-price__symbol e-price__currency" data-ampclass=travel-price__symbol itemprop=currenciesAccepted content="GBP">£</span> <span class="travel-price__price e-price__fee" data-ampclass=travel-price__price>224</span></span><p>• The&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">best boutique hotels in Lisbon</a></p><a href=# data-tmg-dtm-nav=image></a>The soaring tower of the Corinthia Hotel offers memorable views over the impressive 18th-century Aquaduct of Águas Livres, one of Lisbon's most iconic sights.
