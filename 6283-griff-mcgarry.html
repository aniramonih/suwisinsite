McGarry has improved his walk rate drastically from his college days at Virginia, but doesn&#39t yet throw enough strikes to profile as more than a back-end starter. If his strike throwing improves he has mid-rotation or better upside.</p><p><strong>Track Record:</strong> McGarry struggled to throw strikes throughout his collegiate career at Virginia, walking 8.8 batters per nine innings. He compensated for it with three swing-and-miss weapons, posting 12.5 strikeouts per nine. The Phillies were willing to take a gamble on his pure stuff in the fifth round, and he rewarded them with an encouraging pro debut between the Class A levels. He rounded out the year in instructional league.</p><p><strong>Scouting Report:</strong> McGarry might have the best pure stuff of any pitcher in the system, with a 70-grade fastball and a pair of plus offspeeds in his slider and changeup. McGarry&#39s fastball was sitting 96-99 mph this summer, and his mid-80s slider is a dangerous swing-and-miss weapon with two-plane break. But McGarry will only go as far as his bottom-of-the-scale control takes him. This season he changed his delivery to make him more directional toward home plate, and the Phillies felt that change helped his control. The organization was impressed with his ability to throw strikes at instructs, and he also threw his changeup more during games this fall. The Phillies feel like McGarry could help them in the majors as soon as next year, but his control will need to improve for him to get to that point.</p><p><strong>The Future:</strong> McGarry should start the 2022 season back at High-A, but the Phillies will be aggressive in pushing him through the system. He has the stuff to be a mid-rotation starter, but will have to throw more strikes to get there.</p><p><strong>Scouting Grades:</strong> Fastball: 70. Slider: 60. Changeup: 60. Control: 30</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o63SnpmapJyWuqa%2ByJyYZ5ufonyxuMCynKurX2t%2FeX%2BMoKminpZiuqSzwKupsmc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
