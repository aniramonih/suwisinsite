The region is known for its fruit production, especially pears, cherries and plums.</p><h3>Cruise port location</h3><p>There is room for one fairly large ship to dock at the quay right next to the village. Others must anchor, though there is often only one cruise ship scheduled per day. Viking, Fred Olsen, Holland America Line and Cruise & Maritime are regular callers, with P&O, Marella, Seabourn, Princess and others visiting occasionally. Free Wi-Fi is available at the port.</p><h3>Can I walk to any places of interest?</h3><p>Eidfjord is tiny – a docked cruise ship dwarfs the village – and shops, cafes and an art gallery are just a few steps from the quay. Scenic walking trails can be taken from the village.</p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>The tiny Eidfjord village is surrounded by a breathtaking landscape</span> <span class=e-caption__credit itemprop=copyrightHolder data-test=credit><span class=e-caption__credit-description>Credit</span>: iStock</span></figure><h3>Getting around</h3><p>Most guests will choose an excursion from their ship. However, there is a 90-minute local bus tour to the Vøringsfossen waterfall from the tourist office, and similar-length trips to the Nature Centre or a mountain farm. A one-hour Trolltrain (trolley train) ride around the village’s sites is available in high season – be off the ship quickly because queues can form.</p><h3>What to see and do</h3><p>Not a great deal in the village itself, though it is undeniably pretty. Vøringsfossen and Hardangervidda (see below) are what draw the crowds. The Norwegian Nature Centre is worth a visit to experience interactive displays. A number of fruit farms in the area welcome visitors.</p><h3>What can I do in four hours or less?</h3><p>Vøringsfossen is a thundering double waterfall, almost 600ft (183m) tall, pouring into the gorge-like Måbø Valley about 12 miles from Eidfjord. The main viewpoint is between the top of the two falls near the Fossli Hotel – you’ll need sturdy shoes and a reasonable head for heights. The experience will be enhanced from 2020 when new viewpoints are completed.</p><p>Beyond the falls is Europe’s largest mountain plateau, Hardangervidda, part of a national park, across which are distant views of glaciers.</p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>A traditional Norwegian home close to Måbø Valley</span> <span class=e-caption__credit itemprop=copyrightHolder data-test=credit><span class=e-caption__credit-description>Credit</span>: Getty</span></figure><p>Together, these natural wonders make a fine half-day trip offered by all cruise lines. It’s the most popular excursion among guests, and is firmly recommended. Many tours include a stop at the Sima hydroelecric plant, with a huge dam and reservoir; quite a few add a call at the Nature Centre, a few miles outside Eidfjord. Holland America also throws a 45-minute boat ride on the fjord into the mix.</p><p>Marella has an interesting excursion to the now-defunct Tyssen hydro plant on the edge of the very narrow Sørfjorden.</p><p>An alternative half-day trip is available through many cruise lines to the Hardanger Juice and Cider Factory near the traditional village of Ulvik, for tastings and shopping. P&O and Princess Cruises take guests to a fruit-growing area at Ullensvang, down Sørfjorden.</p><p>As in many fjord ports, kayaking and RIB boat outings are available through most cruise lines.</p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>Måbø Valley is just a few minutes' drive from the port</span> <span class=e-caption__credit itemprop=copyrightHolder data-test=credit><span class=e-caption__credit-description>Credit</span>: iStock</span></figure><h3>What can I do in eight hours or less?</h3><p>Choose the waterfall/plateau excursion and you should still have time to walk around the village. Good destinations include the ancient burial mounds known as the Heareid Viking Graves and the Old Church that dates to 1309. Cruise & Maritime offers a guided hike and the Trolltrain visits these sites.</p><p>You can also walk along the river to a lake – cross the river first.</p><p>Viking lists a couple of full-day activities. One combines a scenic drive with a train ride and stops at the waterfall and plateau; the other involves joining a local chef on a traditional fishing boat, then devouring your catch in a historic house.</p><h3>Eat and drink</h3><p>Your ship is likely to be so close to the city you can pop back on board for lunch. Otherwise, there’s just a handful of places to eat ashore, where you could look for pancakes with local berries or a reindeer steak.</p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>Visitors should head to Eidfjord's church for a taste of the Norse buildings throughout the fjords</span> <span class=e-caption__credit itemprop=copyrightHolder data-test=credit><span class=e-caption__credit-description>Credit</span>: Getty</span></figure><h3>Don’t leave without…</h3><p>Buy some local juice to drink during your cruise and a jar or two of fruit jam or chutney to take home.</p><h3>Need to know</h3><h4>Climate</h4><p>The weather can be cool and changeable, even in high summer, up on the Hardangervidda, so pack accordingly.</p><h4>When to visit</h4><p>May and June are good months to visit Eidfjord because of the fruit-tree blossom. These months also host the Hardanger Music Festival. Autumn visitors can join in the Local Food Festival.</p><h4>Language</h4><p>English is widely spoken in Eidfjord.</p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>Two Kjeåsen mountain farms sit high above the fjord</span> <span class=e-caption__credit itemprop=copyrightHolder data-test=credit><span class=e-caption__credit-description>Credit</span>: Getty</span></figure><h4>Closures</h4><p>Shops stay open to cater for the cruise trade. Eating and drinking tends to be expensive.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbHLnp6rmaCde6S7ja6iaKyilsOmuI6cqa6ho5rAcLzOq6tmn6Wesaa%2Fjp6gnZ6apL%2BlecKrrKKrlWK9sL7TZp6uoZSafA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
