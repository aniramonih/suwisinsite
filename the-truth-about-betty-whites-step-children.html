Middle child Martha reportedly took her dad's remarriage the hardest. An insider told the outlet that the 13-year-old "deeply opposed the marriage" and was "very angry at her father and made it clear she did not like Betty." The arguments reportedly caused a lot of grief for Ludden in the years before his death. Still, White has always spoken of her stepchildren fondly so it appears she has patched things up with her once-angry stepdaughter.</p><p dir=ltr>The Ludden children all grew up to be successful. David earned his Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania and went on to become a history professor at his Ivy League alma mater. Martha, meanwhile, received her law degree. Youngest child Sarah dabbled in careers in audiology and dance before totally switching gears and opening her own karate school in Chicago.</p><p dir=ltr>Forty years after Ludden's death, White still has a close relationship with her all-grown-up stepchildren. In 2020, she even spent her 98th birthday with her extended family at her home in Brentwood, California. "She's still close with them and their children," a friend told <a href=#>Closer Weekly</a>. "They'll order food in and have fun."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbG9jaYV1e9OhnGasoqrBqXnAm6aurF2XsrXA2GauoaGkmsBuv9Oep2abmJ65pb7Ep2Y%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
