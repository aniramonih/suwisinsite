The targeted weight class is yet to be revealed but it will most likely be a boxing match. The legend himself made an appearance during Rizin’s New Year’s Eve card at the Saitama Super Arena to announce the incoming bout.</p><p></p><p>Though Rizin puts out MMA matches primarily, Kickboxing and Boxing matches are also not uncommon. At this stage of his career, Manny is highly unlikely to switch to MMA so we can probably see the 44-year-old put his boxing gloves on just like his rival Floyd Mayweather.</p><p>So far, Mayweather has already fought under the banner of Rizin through a similar deal twice. The first fight took place in 2018 and <a href=# rel=noopener>the second fight took place against a famous Japanese YouTuber and fighter named Mikuru Asakura in September 2022</a>. Manny himself attended that fight and probably was intrigued with the concept of taking easy fights against YouTubers/ Not professional fighters to earn huge paydays.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Manny Pacquiao has arrived at <a href=# rel=noopener>#RIZINvsBELLATOR</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/2RtfeqPRtP</a></p><p>— Marc Raimondi (@marcraimondi) <a href=# rel=noopener>December 31, 2022</a></p><p>Since the dawn of the current Millenia, Japan has unofficially adapted the tradition of holding combat sports events during New Year’s Eve. On Saturday’s event, Rizin put together a super stacked card as <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Bellator fighters took on their Rizin counterparts winning all five bouts</a> including a victory from Bellator prospect AJ McKee over lightweight champion Roberto ‘Satoshi’ de Souza.</p><p>Pacquiao initially wanted to take part in politics following his retirement but now seems to have changed his mind. We can only hope he doesn’t make the mistake of fighting one of the Paul brothers and putting a black mark on his legacy.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLzOq6usspmku2%2BvzqZmppmeo8ZuvMCcqK6hkaR6tLHTZquoZZaetKnAjKKlZmpgZ4BurcWtnKtlo560r7XNoGSdnZGheri106Fko5mglrumv8RmpKaZXaS%2FqK3NorGarJmku26%2ByLOgp2c%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
