Before she became a Gunguluza, Lebo had used her maiden name, Mokoena.</p><p class=align-left>The couple got married in 2017 in a beautiful traditional ceremony. The following year, they tied the knot in a lavish affair that took place in Mauritius. The couple flew out around 30 guests and made sure that they had five-star accommodation.</p><p class=align-left>More than 100 people came to the ceremony from South Africa and Mzansi actress <a href=#>Thembi Seete</a> was also in attendance. Lebo's marriage received criticism from the public and rumours began to swirl that there was trouble in paradise.</p><p class=align-left>Taking to social media, Lebo's husband confirmed that the two had called it quits and are currently co-parenting their beautiful son.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/5741923e8f8d6379.png>"Yes, we have been separated for almost a year now and our divorce is almost finalised.

Media personality Khanyi Mbau is in love with her boo Kudzai Mushonga and they seem really happy.</p><p class=align-left>However, Kudzai rubbed a number of social media users up the wrong way when he posted a throwback picture of Khanyi, calling her "dusty". Fans assumed that Kudzai was calling Khanyi dusty because her skin was much darker back in the day.</p><p class=align-left>It's no secret that Khanyi has had cosmetic procedures done to lighten the complexion of her skin.</p><p class=align-left><strong>Enjoyed reading our story?
