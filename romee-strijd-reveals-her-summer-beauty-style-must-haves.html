The 23-year-old model has taken tons of envy-worthy swimsuit photos and always nails the model-off-duty-look when out in the sun. Strijd shared her must-haves with <i>Stylish</i> at <a href=#>Victoria’s Secret</a> in L.A. in celebration of the brand’s Summer Scent event </span><span class=s2>on May 18</span><span class=s1>, and naturally, one of her essentials is a good fragrance.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“I always spray a little perfume on me before leaving the house,” Strijd explains. “Right now my favorite is probably the <a href=#>Bombshell Paradise</a> because it makes me think of summer and the sun. It’s super floral and fruity and I love it.”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>As for some other items she always has on deck? “I always have lip balm in my bag. I love Rosebud Salve or Vaseline… anything simple that really hydrates my lips,” she shares.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Besides keeping her lips moisturized, Strijd relies on a few life-savers to keep her skin looking smooth and fresh on the beach. “The first thing is always sunscreen,” she tells <i>Stylish</i>. “I also love a highlighter and a little bit of oil to give a glow. … I add rich moisturizers after a day on the beach because I feel like my skin and hair are both a little more dry than usual and I love refreshing mists. It helps when it’s hot out!”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>When it comes to her hairstyles, the Victoria’s Secret model likes to keeps it natural.&nbsp;“I love wearing my hair in a bun and I feel like I’m ready to go in the sea or anywhere. If I do go in the water, I love to let it down afterwards because I get a sea-salt, beachy look. I always have a hat too for when it gets super hot and sunscreen isn’t enough anymore,” she says.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Romee-Strijd-01.jpg><p class=p1><span class=s1>Strijd likes to keep her summer fashion choices low-key and uncomplicated too. “My summer style is pretty casual. I love shorts with a big t-shirt and some flip flops. It’s super easy and comfortable. … You want to wear something that’s easy to throw on and off,” she shares.&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1><span class=s1>While her beauty and style regimen may be minimal, Strijd admits that staying in shape to feel confident in a bikini requires some work. “I love a mix of yoga, Pilates and weight training. I do weight training two times a week and yoga three times a week to lengthen. …For me, it’s about working out all year long and drinking a lot of water,” she reveals.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>And picking out the perfect swimsuit has become a harder task since <a href=#>VS Swim</a> launched new bathing suit styles: “I used to be just a bikini lover and only wear bikinis, but since VS Swim is back and released so many different styles, I like to play around.”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Another time the model likes to have fun and experiment is when she’s striking a pose on the beach. “I love spontaneous photos,” she dishes. “Go in the water, splash around and take a photo,” Strijd recommends.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6e8rrHEZqqtqpmfsW6%2BxK%2BcmqSjYrWmvoysrKallad6o7HArquyZaOpxq2xjKasrKxdna63sdJo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
