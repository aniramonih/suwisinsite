The earlier known palaces date back to Egypt and Babylon, where Persian palaces were constructed. While the symmetry and designs changed over the years, each building was made with expensive materials and intricate work that stood the test of time. <a href=#>While most of the palaces were residences</a> used by the royal families, the world has moved away from the monarchy system and most of these buildings have become museums or heritage sites.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>From Buckingham Palace in London, which remains the official and royal residence of the Queen of England, to the Forbidden City Complex in Beijing, which has become its biggest tourist attraction spot, each palace on the list serves a varied purpose. Let’s take a look at the most expensive palaces in the world.</p><h2 id=windsor-castle-uk-236-million>Windsor Castle, UK ($236 million)</h2><p>Windsor Castle dates back to the 11th century when it was constructed for William the Conqueror.
