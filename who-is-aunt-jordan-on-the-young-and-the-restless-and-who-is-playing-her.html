That’s a question fans are asking after Claire’s (Hayley Erin) aunt finally appeared on the show.
Last week, Y&R fans got their first glimpse of Aunt Jordan (Colleen Zenk) when she ensured Claire wasn’t going soft on her in the Friday cliffhanger.
These two have a master plan that kicked off with Claire kidnapping Nikki (Melody Thomas Scott).
Claire and Aunt Jordan have also ensured that Nikki fell off the wagon, losing her sobriety and spiraling into despair."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Eddie Peck) has Y&R fans speculating Aunt Jordan has a connection to him.</p><p>After all, Cole does show up at the lake house looking for Nikki, while Claire lures Victoria, Nick (Joshua Morrow), and Victor (Eric Braeden). Whether Aunt Jordan is related to Cole or not remains to be seen.</p><p>However, all signs point to Claire being Eve, the daughter Cole and Victoria thought they lost. Yes, it’s far-fetched, but remember, it’s a soap, and anything is possible.</p><p>While Y&R fans wait to learn more about Aunt Jordan, her portrayer has given them a little teaser about the character.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-who-is-playing-aunt-jordan-on-y-amp-r>Who is playing Aunt Jordan on Y&R?</h2><p>As The World Turns fan-favorite Colleen Zenk has returned to daytime after 13 years in the role of Claire’s Aunt Jordan.

Head-writer Josh Griffith wrote for Colleen on ATWT and sought her out for the role on The Young and the Restless.</p><p>After chatting briefly, Colleen accepted the role and began working immediately. The actress has kept this secret since last August, when her first scenes were filmed.</p><p>“The way she was described to me was that Jordan would be causing a lot of trouble for a lot of people. And I said, ‘Oh, well, I certainly know how to do that!'” <a href=#>the actress shared with the outlet.</a></p><p>There is no question that Aunt Jordan has been living up to the description Collen Zenk was given of her.</p><p>Aunt Jordan is just getting started on wreaking havoc on the Newman family.
