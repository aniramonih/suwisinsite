She even renewed her contract with the channel for another year on September 1, 2022.</p><p>With this, she became the first MC given a chance to renew the contract with "Music Bank" in history.</p><p>However, she shocked viewers when it was not even a year since the contract renewal when Wonyoung suddenly decided to leave her MC role.</p><p>Due to this, her hosting partner, actor Lee Chae Min, will work with special MCs in the meantime until the female idol's successor MC is finally decided.</p><h2>K-Media Speculate Reasons IVE Jang Wonyoung Left 'Music Bank'</h2><p>Against the background of the drop-off, there are speculations about the real reason Jang decided to part ways with her MC position in "Music Bank" as it wasn't properly stated in Starship Entertainment's official announcement.</p><p>According to <strong><a href=# rel=nofollow>Insight</a></strong>&nbsp;and other media outlets, Jang Wonyoung sacrificed her MC role to focus on her upcoming IVE activities.</p><p>In particular, IVE will hold its first fan concert "The Prom Queens" at the Olympic Hall in Seoul Olympic Park on February 11 and 12. The two performance dates showed the "Love dive" singers' overwhelming ticket-selling power, with all seats sold out at the same time as the opening.</p><p>IVE is reportedly stepping up preparations for the performance to provide a variety of stages and performances with another charm that has not been shown before through "The Prom Queens."</p><p>On the flip side, <strong><a href=# rel=nofollow>other outlets</a></strong>&nbsp;opened up about the sensitive controversy that is currently brewing about the real reason Jang Wonyoung stepped down as MC for "Music Bank." Rumors are spreading that Jang Wonyoung's agency and KBS have conflicts.</p><p>The alleged dispute started when IVE Jang Wonyoung and Leeseo sparked heated discussion after lip-syncing in a year-end stage last year.</p><p>On January 5, KBS, the same entertainment company managing "Music Bank," openly criticized IVE, including Jang, the MC of their own music show.</p><p></p><p>Some who heard the report said it was unusual for KBS to criticize the singer who was the MC of its program, even mentioning her real name.
