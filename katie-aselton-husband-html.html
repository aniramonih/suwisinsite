On August 26, 2006, they married in a beautiful wedding ceremony surrounded by friends and family.&nbsp;&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>They got married in the hills above Silver Lake Reservoir. Aselton is an excellent actress in her own right, but she has had some best performances with her husband and his brother, Jay.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Her acting journey started in 2004 after she was starred opposite her partner in the short film Scrapple. The movie was written and directed by Jay.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2005, Aselton did her first feature-length movie debut named The Puffy Chair. Once again, she starred opposite her husband, who directed the movie with his brother.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Since then, she has worked on several projects with the Duplass brothers. The longest project Aselton worked on with her spouse was The League. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The show revolved around six friends who took part in a fantasy football league. Aselton played the role of&nbsp;Jenny MacArthur, whereas Duplass portrayed Peter "Pete"&nbsp;Eckhart.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><strong>Katie Aselton and her husband, Mark Duplass, celebrating their 15-year-anniversary. </strong>(Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>)</p><p>The pair starred in the show for seven seasons&nbsp;from 2009 to 2015. In an interview with the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">US TODAY</a>, they explained why they did not play a couple in the show.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Aselton admitted that she "had better chemistry with Steve Rannazzisi."&nbsp;Rannazzisi played the role of&nbsp;Kevin MacArthur, Aselton's on-screen husband, in The League. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-618 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>She added the two starred as a bickering couple in The Puffy Chair, and they wanted to do something different from that. She wanted to "get jobs doing other things that aren't necessarily always" with Duplass.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>She joked she would like to show her range and "kiss another guy."</p><h2>Katie Aselton and Mark Duplass's Children&nbsp;</h2><p>Aselton and Duplass have two children together. After a year of marriage, the pair welcomed their first daughter, Ora, in 2007.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Ora was young while her parents were filming The League, so the couple had to manage their time. In the same interview with the US TODAY, they opened up about their family.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-174 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>They usually drove together to work when they had the same schedule. But since Ora was two at the time, Aselton and Duplass managed time.&nbsp;</p><p>They tried to maximize any hours they were not working to be with their child. For example, if one of them had an extra scene, the other would leave to be with their daughter.&nbsp;</p><p>The duo was blessed with their second daughter, Molly, in 2012. Ora and Molly were very close with their cousins, Mimi and Sam, children of Jay.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The brothers told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="follow noopener">The Washington Post</a> that their older children were "spiritual soul mates." Both Aselton and Duplass often post pictures of their children on social media.&nbsp;</p><p>However, they do not reveal their faces to shield their daughters from the spotlight.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKORqbamecCsnKWsn6N6qcHSm5innF6dwa64</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
