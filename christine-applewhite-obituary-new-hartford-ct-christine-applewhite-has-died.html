Christine was born on April 15, 1975, and she resided in Torrington for the majority of her childhood years until attending the University of Wilmington in North Carolina, from which she graduated. She was quite involved in the Alpha Xi Delta organization. There, Billy Applewhite and she had their wedding, after which they moved to New Hartford and started a family.</p><p>The birth of Christine’s son Slade William Applewhite in February 2011 made Christine’s lifelong dream of being a mother a reality. She has never been happier or more proud of herself than she is right now since she has finally found her soul mate. She placed a very high value on their friendship. In addition, Christine has devoted her life to the field of food safety. She spent many years working in the Department of Public Health for the state of Connecticut before excitedly beginning her career in food safety with the FDA.</p><p>She was well-liked by her workplace, and she had a large number of friends who were loyal to her. Christine was an avid hiker who wished to visit all of the country’s national parks. She had already visited many of the parks on her bucket list. She also delighted in the tranquility of canoeing on West Hill Pond. Along with her grandmother Catherine Gawrych, her grandfather Neil Hanlon, and a large number of aunts, uncles, cousins, and friends, Christine is survived by her parents, Andrea and Gary Gawrych, Frank and Wendy Jersey, and their children, Maizey and Colton, Jennifer Jersey (Andrew) Murphy and Victoria Jersey (Stefan) Kramer, as well as her son Slade. Her previous husband and both sets of grandparents passed away before she did. The absence of Christine leaves a hole in the hearts of everyone who cares about her. She was forthright and opinionated, a hard worker, and a student for the rest of her life. Her absence will always be keenly felt to a significant degree.</p>0<span class=mashsb-sharetext>SHARES</span><a class="mashicon-facebook mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Share</span></a><a class="mashicon-twitter mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Tweet</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmihnqG8t7XNoKSepZ%2Bntqa%2FzZ6urGaTpLpwr8eroKysmaOybq3PqaOer5iewaZ5zpugra2Rp8ZuusSwZKGZoqmzsL7DZpqtZZOdv6q%2F06KlnmWRpb2tsdahoK2dXZ2utHnDopydZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
