But, as we look forward to a summer full of fun and drama, it's difficult to not think back to <i>Big Brother 17</i> and wonder what your favorite houseguests from that season are doing now, especially the ones involved in showmances, one of the most beloved of all <i>Big Brother</i> activities. In particular, it seemed like <a href=# class=T3D><i>Big Brother 17</i> stars Shelli Poole and Clay Honeycutt</a> had the best chance of transcending showmance status and becoming a full-fledged couple in the real world. So <a href=# class=T3D>are Shelli and Clay still together</a> today?</p><p>Unfortunately, all good things must come to an end, even Clelli. That's right. It appears that Shelli and Clay broke up around November 2015 as per an announcement Shelli posted on Instagram that month. "I adore this guy," Shelli captioned a photo of herself and Clay looking cute as always. "We shared a great relationship on <i>Big Brother</i>, but 'real life' is much different than '<i>BB</i> life.' There was no drama or hard feelings, we simply moved on as dear friends. We are both happy and thank y'all for your incredible sweetness and love!"</p><p>But you can't say that Clelli didn't give it the old college try. First of all, they had an immediate connection upon meeting in the <i>Big Brother </i>house and practically became a couple on the spot. Shelli and Clay were each other's strongest allies in the competition and remained faithful to each other to the end. And, if you've ever watched <i>Big Brother</i>, you know that is <i>very</i> difficult to do.</p><p>They even survived being torn a part when <a href=# class=T3D>Clay was evicted from the <i>Big Brother</i> house</a> first. The amount of tears they both shed over the thought of having to survive a few weeks without each other last summer seemed to suggest that there was some genuine love between them.</p><p>Even though <a href=# class=T3D>Shelli would eventually be evicted the following week</a>, she was then sequestered in the Jury House until the <i>Big Brother 17 </i>finale night in September, when she would finally be reunited with Clay. And oh, what a reunion it was! Shelli and Clay picked their relationship up right where they left off — and then some. Apparently, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Clay met Shelli's family</a>, and she planned to travel to Texas for their first date and to meet his relatives, she said in an interview with CarterMatt.com on finale night.</p><p>And, it looks like Shelli did indeed make it out to Texas to see Clay.</p><p>They took a few swoonworthy photos as it looked like Clelli would be alive and well for years (well, at least <i>months</i>) to come.</p><p>But, just a few weeks later came the end of Clelli. These days, it's unclear if either Shelli or Clay has a special someone in his or her life, but with their gorgeous looks (seriously, have you seen <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Clay's new modeling photos on Instagram</a> lately?) and sweet, southern charm, they shouldn't be lonely for long.</p><p>And, if they ever felt like reviving Clelli outside of the <i>Big Brother</i> house, I definitely wouldn't mind.</p><p><i>Image: CBS</i></p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunCt0a2gnKSVqHxygpdpanFlkaeybr%2FHnqOloV2YuaLFjKyroqScYsGws8Stn56qXZaztbHRZpmin12Xv7DAx56pZmlnYsGpsYypmKKqXam%2FqrHDZquoZZ2WuKZ5yK0%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
