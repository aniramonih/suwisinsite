Pain - without love,
Pain - I can't get enough.
Pain - I like it rough,
'Cause I'd rather feel pain than nothing at all.[Verse 1]
You're sick of feeling numb,
You're not the only one.
I'll take you by the hand,
And I'll show you a world that you can understand.
This life is filled with hurt,
When happiness doesn't work.
Trust me and take my hand,
When the lights go out you will understand.</description></item><item><title>10 Best Private Hospitals In Lagos, Nigeria</title><link>/10-best-private-hospitals-in-lagos-nigeria.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/10-best-private-hospitals-in-lagos-nigeria.html</guid><description>Are you new in Lagos and you wish to know the best private hospitals in Lagos just in case you or a close one need medical attention?

It’s hard for an accessory to stand out amongst a sea of Barbie-core pink flowers, but when the supermodel and Rhode Beauty founder paired that halter dress with a chunky pair of gold hoops, we couldn’t help but be drawn to them.</description></item><item><title>Ariana Madixs Brother: Tom Having Mid-Life Crisis Amid Raquel Affair</title><link>/ariana-madixs-brother-tom-having-mid-life-crisis-amid-raquel-affair.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/ariana-madixs-brother-tom-having-mid-life-crisis-amid-raquel-affair.html</guid><description>Standing by his sister.

Wd40 has its place and serves a certain function. It may operate as a beginning fluid, but it is not a starting fluid in the traditional sense.
&amp;nbsp;
Aside from that, what can I use as a beginning fluid? Premixed gas from lawn equipment, chainsaws, ice augers, or any other kind of premixed gas will work just well. Premix is important because if it doesn’t start, it will dry out the cylinder walls, which isn’t a good thing.</description></item><item><title>Career, Gender Issues, Girlfriend &amp;amp; Net Worth</title><link>/timmy-thick-age-height-career-gender-girlfriend-net-worth.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/timmy-thick-age-height-career-gender-girlfriend-net-worth.html</guid><description>Social media has been a pretty good place to showcase the skills and talent that individuals possess, and well, some of them have come pretty good from it.

あれからすでに２年の歳月が流れようとしてます。
元々馴れ初めは２０１１年で、
３年半の交際を経ての結婚でしたが、
互いに子持ちだっという背景から、
結婚当初は難しい意見が多くありました。
実際に２年の月日を迎えて、
吉井和哉さんと眞鍋さんの結婚生活は、
どれだけ順調なのか？
週刊誌などでは、
比較的にネガティブな記事もありますが、
本当のところはどのような感じなのか・・・。
吉井和哉と真鍋かをりは離婚する？
互いに再婚を果たして僅かな時間しか流れてませんが、
某週刊誌などでは、雲行きがあやしいという内容の記事が出てます。
忙しく全国を駆け巡る吉井和哉さんのことを考えると、
ファンにとっては面白い内容ではないですね・・・。
12月15日発売の「女性自身」（光文社）では、怪しい雲行きを伝えている。同誌記事によると、眞鍋にとって初めての子供がまだ生後2カ月であるにも関わらず、吉井は育児のサポートを一切行わないという。「吉井が育児をなにもサポートしてくれないため、眞鍋が『もう離婚しちゃおうかな』と周囲に愚痴っている」という内容の芸能関係者のコメントもあり、穏やかではない。
同誌は都内の高級スーパーでひとり買い物を終えた眞鍋を直撃取材。眞鍋は記者の出産を祝う言葉に「ありがとうございます」と笑顔で応答し、「吉井さんとの夫婦関係はどうですか？」との質問には「取材は直接お答えすることはできないんです」とにこやかなままで答えたという。笑顔の裏にある真意は？眞鍋の所属事務所は、別居や不仲について「離婚は絶対にありません」と宣言している。引用元：http://www.excite.co.jp/News/entertainment_g/20151215/Messy_5562.html?_p=2
吉井和哉さんがすでに育児にネガティブとされてますが、
これはあくま憶測でしかなく、
実際は、ライブツアーに忙しく、
なかなか心の余裕が作れないのかな？と。
眞鍋さん側は不仲や別居の噂に関しては、
離婚することはないと言及してますが、
やはり本人たちの口からはっきり聞いてみたいですね。
１４歳の年の差が単純に難しかったのか？など、
難しい事情は置いておいて、素朴な問題である可能性だってありますからね。
しかし、不思議なぐらいに、
吉井和哉さんと眞鍋さんが揃った写真がないのが、
ちょっと違和感あるなとは、思います。
吉井和哉と真鍋かをりの目撃と世田谷に新居の噂(フライデーではない) 吉井和哉さんが自宅に帰る姿が、
なかなか目撃されないということで、
別居してるか、吉井さんが一方的に出て行ったか・・・。
この部分に関しては、まだまだ確信ある報道はないですが、
ラブラブなツーショットがないのは寂しいですね！
子供が大きくなった時に、
３人で手を繋いでる和やかな光景があればなと！
だが、結婚の意思を公表したものの、すぐに入籍とはいかなかった。入籍はなぜか9月。8月には早くも二人の間に不協和音が鳴り響いているとの説が出始めていた。6月以降、二人が住むマンション周辺では、吉井の姿が見かけられなくなったという。身重の妻のサポートをすることなく、吉井がひとりで家を出て行ったとも報道されたが……これに対してはちょうど全国各地で開催される夏の音楽フェスに出演するためではないかと楽観視する向きもあった引用元：http://www.excite.co.jp/News/entertainment_g/20151215/Messy_5562.html
そもそも吉井和哉さんは暇な方ではないので、
単純に音楽に集中するために、色々と工夫をされているだけかも？
今年２０１７年も、イエモンは大きなライブツアーを控えてます。
リハーサル、演出の確認から、
吉井和哉さんの作業量は膨大なはずです。
普通のお父さんのように、
毎日、家に帰って家族サービスするのは、
なかなか難しいように感じます。
イエモンのライブが終わった後も、色々と忙しそう・・・・、
元ファンである眞鍋さんであれば、それを理解して支えることはできると信じましょう！
今年の１１月１１日には、
イエモンのドキュメント映画、
「オトトキ」が公開されるので、
そこで吉井和哉さんの私生活の一部は見れそうです。
きっと、忙しくて、忙しくて・・・な吉井和哉さんの姿が映ってるはずです！
結婚とイエモンの再結成、新曲、ツアーが重なるのは、
ちょっと時期的には難しかったのかなと思います。
ちなみにネット上で世田谷に新居を購入したような噂がありますが、
これが本当なら、まだまだ夫婦仲良しってことですかね？？
新居の話は週刊誌でなく、ただのネット上での話なので何も信憑性がないですが。

これまでにもパリ、ミラノなど、世界中のコレクションに登場し、世界的デザイナーのカール・ラガーフェルドさんやマーク・ジェイコブスさんに認知されてきました。
そんな冨永愛さんですが、私生活では恋多き女性として有名です。
過去に有名な俳優さんと熱愛をしたり、パティシエの男性と結婚したり、自立した女性らしく自然体な恋愛をしてきました。
また、旦那さんとの間に生まれた子供との関係も素敵で、母親としても素晴らしい方です。
今日は冨永愛さんの過去の恋愛と結婚、離婚、そして子供との関係について書いてみたいと思います。
そして、恋愛だけでなく、人気アーティスト・長渕剛さんとの特殊な友情の形についても書いてみたいと思います。
冨永愛の結婚と離婚理由。元旦那はパリ在住の日本人パティシエ 冨永愛さんは２００４年にパリ在住の日本人のパティシエの方と結婚しています。
当時の冨永愛さんは２２歳で、メディアでは”世界で活躍する日本人モデル”として注目され始めたばかりの時期でした。
話題になり始めたばかりのあの頃に、実はすでに結婚していたと思うとビックリですね！
そして、結婚した翌年の２００５年の３月に男の子を出産したということで、授かり婚だったとされています。
２３歳で第一子を産んだということになります。
その後、2008年には旦那と別居されていることが報道されました。
この時、冨永愛さんはブログで、
「息子が幼稚園に通うことになったので、通園の拠点を考えたうえで引越ししたと本人から聞いています。もちろん普通にケンカもあるでしょうが、それはどこの夫婦でもあることでしょう」
「夫婦は山あり谷ありで、喧嘩もしますが（記事は多少過大）、3人で頑張っています」
と報道の内容を否定されました。
しかし、２００９年に離婚したことが報道されました。
その際にはブログで、
「どこの夫婦にもあるように、私達にも色々な事がありました」
「夫婦として歩んで行く中で、お互いのすれ違いや、進むべき道を見据えた上で、別々の道を歩んで行った方が、お互いにとっていいだろうと判断致しました」
「一生一緒に生きて行こうと誓った仲ですし、大切な息子もいますから、この決断は簡単に出した答えではありません。」
「もちろん母として、息子と二人で生きて行く不安はありますが、私らしく、前向きに生きて行こうと思います！ 皆さんこれからも温かい目で見守っていて下さい」
と、当時の離婚報道の内容の一部を否定しながらも、苦渋の決断で離婚したことを明かしていました。
当時、冨永さんは元旦那との離婚報道を否定されていましたが、それはプライベートな情報を守るためだったとされています。
冨永愛と旦那の離婚理由は嫉妬深さ。モラハラ説や収入格差説はガセ。元夫はどんな人だった？ 冨永愛さんの元旦那さんは年上でした。
馴れ初めは冨永愛さんがパリコレモデル時代にパリで出会っています。
元旦那さんの写真や、詳しい情報は公表されていませんが、現在の息子の姿から想像すると、章胤さんの眉毛とまつ毛は冨永愛さんよりも太く濃く、重いまぶたでより吊り上がった目をしているということで、毛が濃くて一重から奥二重の吊り目の男性だったのではないか？と憶測されています。
旦那との離婚の理由としては、冨永さん自身がのちに、
「嫉妬深いことが原因だった」
と語っています。
当時の週刊誌の報道の中には、
・パーティで冨永さんがノリでバニーガールのコスプレをしたら、旦那さんが大激怒。大勢の前で冨永さんに土下座謝罪を要求した。
・収入格差ゆえに夫婦でのすれ違いが起きていた。
という内容が書かれていましたが、それに対してはブログで、
「私達夫婦はご存知の通り海外を行き来する機会が多く、こういった事を招いてしまったと思っています。皆様にはご心配をかけた事と思いますが、特にそういう事実もありませんので、ご心配なさらないで下さい」
と否定していました。
離婚をブログで報告した際には、「彼が将来幸せになってくれる事を願っています」と綴られており、決して喧嘩別れをしたわけではなさそうです。
冨永愛の歴代の熱愛報道。離婚後に塩谷瞬と熱愛するも２股事件で破局。山本太郎や紀里谷とも関係 冨永愛さんが離婚後に熱愛の噂が出たのは2011年頃です。
当時は俳優として活躍されていた山本太郎さんと交際されていました。
冨永さんと山本太郎さんは、原発の問題で意気投合し交際に発展したのです。
冨永さんから結婚を意識していたそうですが、山本太郎さんはそこまでの将来は考えておらず、結局は破局してしまいました。
その後に、2012年頃に俳優の塩谷瞬さんと交際しました。
俳優の塩谷瞬さんとはお付き合いの末、プロポーズまで受けていたようです。
しかし、神田うのさんの提示した証拠で、塩谷瞬さんが料理研究家の園田真希絵さんにもプロポーズしていることが発覚したのです。
三角関係であったことが発覚すると、塩谷さんは世間からもうバッシングを受け、カメラの前で涙ながら謝罪することとなりました。
塩谷さんは二股交際の事実を認め、2人に直接会って謝罪したそうです。もちろん2人とは破局しました。
ただ、後に冨永さんも塩谷さんと交際した時点で山本太郎さんと完全に切れてなかったとの噂があるので、本当ならどっちもどっちですね・・・。
ちなみ、当時の週刊誌では、
「愛ちゃんは大きくなっていく息子さんのためには、男親がいたほうがいいと考えるようになったんです。山本さんとの関係がダメになっていく一方で、塩谷くんも気になっていったんじゃないですか。それで、山本さんと別れ、出会って間もないけど、自分だけでなく、子供のことも愛してくれる塩谷くんと、急速に親密になっていったんです」（前出・冨永の知人）
と、当時の冨永さんが、我が子の為に新しいお父さんを求めていたことが伝えられており、その焦りが出てしまったのではないか？とされています。
紀里谷や長渕剛とも熱愛の噂があった。不倫はガセネタ 冨永愛さんの元カレとして有名なのが山本太郎さんと塩谷瞬さんですが、その他にも噂になった有名人が何人かいます。
2011年頃から山本太郎さんと交際した冨永愛さんですが、実はその1年前に映画監督の紀里谷さんとも噂になっていたのです。

まず目を奪われるのは、
小野武正さんのアグレッシヴなギタープレイです。
走って跳ねて、左右のお客さんをバランスよく煽り、
「顔」でギターを奏でる、非常に華のある方です。
そんな小野武正さんのギターの腕ですが、
具体的にはどれだけ上手いのでしょうか？
２０代のギタリストの中では、
存在感は圧倒的だと思いますが、
技術的な評価というのが気になります。
小野武正のギターの上手さ(画像・動画) 小野武正さんは１４歳からクラシックギターを習い、
バンドを始めた当初からその腕前は、
同級生とは比較にならないほどだったようです。
音大までギターを習っていたということで、
独学で頑張ったというよりも、
しっかりと基礎から学んでいった方だといえます。
聞かれますね。やっぱり練習だと思わないで、好きな曲を弾いてるのが良いですよね。楽しいから何時間でも弾けるし、それが良いサイクルになって上手くなると思います。やっぱり教則本っていうのは僕も苦手で（笑）。でも高校と音大を含めて、7年間ギターを習っていたんで、そこでレッスンがあったのが今となっては大きいですけど。それがなかったら、もしかして今みたいになってなかったんじゃないかな、とは思います。引用元：https://www.barks.jp/news/?id=1000096401
小野武正さんがの凄さは、
ライブであれだけ動きながらも、
正確にギターを奏でられることです。
まるでベースのような動き・・・？
（いや、ちょっと違うか）
洋楽で例えるならば、
ACDCのアンガス・ヤングのような、
彼のギターがライブの「顔」に見えるほど強いのです。
キートークは他メンバーも、
等身大のメジャーバンドの実力を持っていますが、
小野武正さんただ一人が、頭一つ抜けた演奏力を持っていると思います。
また、技術的なことだけでなく、
作曲する曲のリフのキャッチャーさも含めて、
２０代のギタリストの中ではトップレベルの方じゃないかなと・・・。
（個人的な予想）
小野武正の作曲能力とエフェクター(ブログ) 小野武正さんといえば、
ギブソンのSGのイメージが強く、
アプローチもエッジの効いたプレイが魅力です。
本人のSGに対するこだわりはいつからなのか？と、
過去のインタビューを遡ってみると、
なんと、高校生の頃に初めて買ったギターがSGだったようです。
SGってギブソンだとかなり高くないですか？高校生なのにお金持ち・・・。
個人的にはあらゆる点で、
ACDCのアンガス・ヤングとかぶります。
短パン（毎回ではないが）にSGというスタイルで、
アグレッシヴに弾きまくり、
顔で弾いてるような表情の豊かさ、
そしてキャッチなリフを生み出し続けてセンス。
和製アンガス・ヤングが誰かと聞かれれば、
間違いなく、自分は小野武正さんの名前を挙げます。
（自分ごときの素人が偉そうにすみません）
いつしか、ワイヤレスアンプに変えたそうですが、
それが今の動き回るスタイルに拍車をかけたのでしょうか？
そして、エフェクターは何を使ってるのかというと、
「IBANEZ ES2（アナログディレイ）」を使用してみたいです。
キートークの楽曲の良さである、
音抜けの良さは、このエフェクターの恩恵かもしれません。
そして、王道の「IBANEZ TS9（オーバードライブ）」ですが、
これはワイヤレスアンプとの相性が良いみたいです。
「IbanezのAnalog Delay ES2」というエフェクターも愛用しており、
こいつに関しては過去にインタビューで言及されてます。
原音の奥につくようなディレイがアナログなサウンドを感じさせ心地よいです。
OSCILLATIONやMODULATIONの操作も簡単にでき、もちろんタップですぐにテンポも決められるのでアナログとデジタルの両方の持ち味を簡単にいいとこ取りできる感じで、ライブでもレコーディングでも即戦力になると思います。引用元：http://www.ibanez.co.jp/news/f_products/2013/ES2/review.html
ライブだけでなくレコーディングでも愛用してるみたいで、</description></item><item><title>Actress, Ione Skye and her husband, Ben Lee Welcomed baby girl</title><link>/ione-skye.html</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/ione-skye.html</guid><description>Ione Skye is a British-American actress, author, and painter, who is best known for her various works.
