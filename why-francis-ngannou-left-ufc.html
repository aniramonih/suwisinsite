At the age of 10, Ngannou started working in a sand quarry in Batié to help support his family.</p><p>Growing up, <a href=# rel=noopener>Ngannou</a> faced many challenges. He was approached by several gangs in his village to join them, but he refused and decided to pursue boxing instead.</p><p>He was motivated by his father’s negative reputation as a street fighter and wanted to do something positive with his life. At the age of 22, Ngannou began training in boxing, despite his family’s initial reluctance.</p><p>After training for a year, Francis Ngannou stopped training due to an illness. He then did various odd jobs to make ends meet, including working in a factory and as a security guard.</p><p>However, at the age of 26, he decided to pursue professional boxing and headed to Paris, France. Upon reaching Europe, he was jailed for two months in Spain for illegally crossing the border.</p><p>After Francis Ngannou reached Paris, he had no money, no friends, and no place to live. He lived homeless on the streets of Paris, where he faced many challenges. However, his life changed when he met Francis Carmont, who introduced him to Fernand Lopez and the MMA factory.</p><p>Initially interested in learning how to box, Ngannou was convinced by Lopez to try MMA instead. Lopez gave Ngannou some MMA gear and allowed him to train and sleep at the gym for no cost, thus starting Ngannou’s MMA career.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Why Francis Ngannou left UFC?</h2><p>At present, Francis Ngannou is without a contract, having failed to reach an agreement with the UFC on a new deal.
