In addition, he established the independent record label known as The Sauce Factory during that same year. During the course of his rap career, the individual who is a father of one and who has an astounding 1.6 million followers on Instagram has been involved in a few disputes with the authorities.</p><p>When Walka entered a guilty plea to the charge of dangerous conduct in 2009, he was involved in a gun-related event. The incident occurred after a shooting occurred during a concert that was held at Texas Southern University. He led Houston police on a high-speed chase before crashing his vehicle early on Wednesday morning, which resulted in the rapper Sauce Walka being taken into custody.</p><p>According to Fox 26, the hitmaker of “Big Drip Squad,” who is 33 years old, is facing charges of avoiding arrest or detention after he reached speeds of 130 miles per hour for more than two miles in an attempt to evade the police. Albert Walker Mondale, better known by his stage moniker Sauce Walka, is scheduled to make an appearance in court on Friday.</p><p>The year 2007 marked the beginning of Walka’s career as a rapper, during which he was a member of the Houston rap group Mostheard and used the alias A-Walk. Subsequently, in 2014, he changed his stage name to Sauce Walka, and later that same year, he joined up with the rapper Sancho Saucy to form a duet that they called Sauce Twinz.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmidpJq%2Fr63Loaanp6Keu6h6wqikaKuRqrCmedaao6SZXZ22qLSMrKeenZRisKmt0p5kq5mgpbKzecCrqZ6rpJqxbrLOpaOor5mjtG60yKCfZqugmrKlecKhmKydXay2tbSMra9mqJ%2BhtqSxjJucn6eimnqkvsCsn2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
