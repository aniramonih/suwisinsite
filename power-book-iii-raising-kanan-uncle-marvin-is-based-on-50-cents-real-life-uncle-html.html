In order to flesh out who Kanan was, they also used elements of 50 Cent’s real life. “These are real things, like, I really experienced being roughed up in the park before my mom sent me back to the park, and I was just more afraid of her than the kids in the park, so I ended up going back to fight them instead of dealing with my mom,” the rapper told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sky News.</a>&nbsp;</p><p id=par-5_27>However, it’s not just a version of 50 Cent who appears on the screen. People from his family are also seen through some of the characters.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-2></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-uncle-marvin-is-based-on-50-cent-s-real-life-uncle-in-power-book-iii-raising-kanan>Uncle Marvin is based on 50 Cent’s real-life uncle in ‘Power Book III: Raising Kanan’</h2><p id=par-6_32>Since so many elements of Kanan’s life are also based on 50 Cent’s life, it makes sense that Uncle Marvin is based on one of the rapper/executive producer’s real-life family members.</p><p id=par-7_118>“My Uncle Horace is a lot like Marvin,” 50 Cent told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TV Line</a>. “He’s the kind of person who can handle altercations and do aggressive things, but he gets in his own way. My Uncle Horace made a lot of crazy decisions and moves in business that still don’t make sense when I hear the stories. He’s been like that my entire life. When talking about my uncle with [Power Book III: Raising Kanan creator] Sascha [Penn], I told him about things I experienced with him and gave him a pretty clear canvas to paint the picture on. Uncle Horace wasn’t in all of the scenarios you see on the television, but he’s definitely on his own page.”</p><p id=par-8_67>As the older brother, it’s clear that Marvin has some issues with his younger sister Raq running the family’s drug empire. “There are some issues that Marvin has to work out,” Brown explained. “Until he resolves his personal issues, it’s best that Raq runs things. He may not necessarily agree with that, but he’s still loyal and he still absolutely takes orders and holds it down.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-3></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-is-kanan-s-uncle-marvin-actually-breeze-in-power-book-iii-raising-kanan>Is Kanan’s Uncle Marvin actually Breeze in ‘Power Book III: Raising Kanan’?</h2><p id=par-9_99>Though Uncle Marvin is clearly a wild card, it’s clear that Kanan trusts him, especially when he’s afraid to go to Raq about things. When Power Universe fans were first introduced to adult Kanan in the second season of Power, he spoke about his partner Breeze, with whom he ran his drug empire. Together, the men mentored Ghost (Omari Hardwick) and Tommy (Joseph Sikora). We also learned that Ghost killed Breeze. &nbsp;“I was your age when I killed him,” Ghost tell’s his son Tariq (Michael Rainey Jr.). “I killed Breeze because he got in the way of my future.”</p><p id=par-10_112>Since Breeze is currently nowhere to be found in Power Book III: Raising Kanan, some fans are now looking at Marvin. “My character basically introduces Kanan into this lifestyle that&nbsp;Power&nbsp;fans know him for,” Brown told journalist Landon Buford on&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Instagram</a>. “And the fact that my sister is in charge because I was irresponsible with it when I was in the position. So, that creates a little beef between us and a bit of a power struggle. In the relationship with my daughter [Juke Box], we don’t see eye to eye just on the father-daughter type of thing. So, the only person that my character can use his authoritative energy on is young Kanan.”</p><p id=par-11_12>Could it be possible that Marvin and Breeze are the same person?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9sMPEq2Sbp5%2Bgeqq1yGapmqGjnruoecqapZqmXaq7pLjEZqSaqqaeu2610maZmquVmXqwuoxuZ2ablaPBtHnRnpilZZyes6Z51KeapZ1encGuuI4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
