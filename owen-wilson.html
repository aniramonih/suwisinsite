Soon after, Wilson moved to Hollywood with his two brothers.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-915 data-method=placement-service></span><p>While there, he went on to co-write three other films with Anderson: Rushmore (1998), The Royal Tenenbaums (2001) and The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou (2004). Tenenbaums earned the duo an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Screenplay, while Wilson also co-starred in that film and Life Aquatic.</p><p>In addition to his collaborations with Anderson, Wilson has appeared in several big-budget films with a comedic actor (and good friend) Ben Stiller, including Meet the Parents (2000) and its two sequels, Zoolander (2001) and Starsky & Hutch (2004). Wilson scored one of his biggest box office successes with 2005’s Wedding Crashers, starring opposite Vince Vaughn.</p><p>Wilson also contributed his voice to the animated smash hit Cars (2006). Around this time, he was romantically linked to his You, Me and Dupree (2006) co-star Kate Hudson, but the couple broke up in 2007. Wilson was previously romantically linked to Jessica Simpson, Jennifer Aniston, and Sheryl Crow.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-916 data-method=placement-service></span><p>Wilson stepped back into the spotlight in October 2007 when he attended the Los Angeles premiere of Wes Anderson’s The Darjeeling Limited, in which he co-starred. In 2008, he starred in the comedies Drillbit Taylor and Marley & Me.</p><p>Wilson then garnered acclaim for his role in 2009’s The Fantastic Mr. Fox and later voiced other animated characters in Marmaduke (2010), Cars 2 (2011), and Free Birds (2013).</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span><p>Additional films on his slate have included Woody Allen’s Midnight in Paris (2011) and Inherent Vice (2014), Paul Thomas Anderson’s adaptation of the Thomas Pynchon novel. In 2015 Wilson tried his hand in an action thriller called No Escape, co-starring Pierce Brosnan and Lake Bell.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><h2>Owen Wilson Wow GIF</h2><p>The cause of all this wowing has never been fully explained. It may be an instinctual ad-lib for Wilson; it may be a byproduct of the gentle, gee-whiz, airhead roles he tends to play; it may be, as he’s joked in an interview, a knowing bit of fan service. What’s clear is why directors keep it in their final cuts: Wilson does work with this tiny word.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-917 data-method=placement-service></span><p><img decoding=async src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/media1.tenor.com/images/1dd03671ab0311a6ec446dd1ce4d91a9/tenor.gif?itemid=6103373" alt="Image result for Owen Wilson Wow GIF" width=573 height=322 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>It all begins with his distinctive voice, a scratched whisper whose reedy, forward tone feels inseparable from his twice-broken nose. I’m convinced that this tenor has ASMR-like effects, satisfying some cerebral thirst and singling Wilson out for imitation.</p><p>Indeed, his “wow” entered memedom by way of a more general parody in 2013, when YouTuber Andrew Barber toured Vancouver as Wilson, reacting to everything with raspy delight.</p><h2>Owen Wilson and Jackie Chan</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Jackie Chan quickly rose to fame in the United States in the late 1990s thanks to his co-starring turn alongside Chris Tucker in the action-comedy Rush Hour, which turned into a franchise.
