You can just tell he's a good guy, which is very welcome on the tour considering we still have to deal with assholes like Kyrgios, Rune etc. There are few genuinely nice guys on the tour. This is why Alcaraz has gotten so popular so fast. Sure, it's because he's talented and fun to watch, but also because of his personality and sweet disposition. His smile lights up the room. He is a very good role model, he represents his country well. He and his coach Juan Carlos Ferrero should be proud, his whole family should.

Old news now. We all know he lost to a journeyman. He is still the number 1 ranked tennis player in the world. Anyone can have an off day. Let's see how he does in Roland Garros before claiming he's "over". This loss can be a blessing in disguise for him. He has played A LOT lately. Some of his fans wanted him to skip Rome anyway. He didn't, but he lost early. Now he has the time to rest and train for Roland Garros.</p><table class="info small"><tr><td class=by>by <span>Anonymous</span></td><td class=count>reply 84</td><td class=timestamp><span>May 16, 2023 7:30 PM</span></td></tr></table><p>Latin leche, baby.
