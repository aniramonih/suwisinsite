I think I am going to let all of Disney Channel down,'" she said.</p><p>In the end, she decided to stick with the show up until it <a href=#>came to an end</a> after four seasons. She was able to execute the roles of both characters so seamlessly that viewers were likely none the wiser about the inner turmoil she faced.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamlhaYZze8OorZ5lk5a6pr7Op6pmrKKWtKqvjKWgn51dqMGwvtho</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
