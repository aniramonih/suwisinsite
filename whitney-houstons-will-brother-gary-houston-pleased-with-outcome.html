The money will be held in a trust until Bobbi Kristina turns 21, then other disbursements until her final payout at the age of 30, according to <a href=# rel=noopener>RadarOnline.com</a>.</p><p>The late megastar first signed a will a month prior to birthing Bobbi Kristina, but an exclusive <a href=# rel=noopener>new report per Forbes</a> insists <a href=# rel=noopener>Whitney Houston</a>‘s updated her will last in 2004, disregarding previous reports that a 1993 and a 2000 will were the latest. Even so, such changes only removes Whitney’s brother Michael and his wife Donna as trustees while evoking Pat Houston (her other brother Gary Houston’s wife and longtime manager) as executor. TMZ caught up with Gary after he landed in New York from Atlanta and inquired about his feelings pertaining to Houston’s last will and testament: “I dont concern myself with any of that [will stuff] … All I know is my sister’s gone.”</p><p>Though the “I Wanna Dance With Somebody” singer amended her will to include her ex-husband in both wills, Bobby Brown’s status of receiving anything from the Queen of Pop is the same—nothing.</p><p>Which should come as no surprise, before the two married, Whitney signed a prenuptial agreement which banned Bobby from accessing her will.</p><p>“Houston shall have the right to dispose of her Separate Property by Last Will and Testament in such manner as she may, in her own uncontrolled discretion deem proper…All future earnings, income, and accumulations resulting from each of the party’s respective personal activities, skills, efforts and work (including but not limited to each party’s respective earnings, income and accumulations derived from recording contracts, movie contracts, other media contracts, concert tours, endorsements, personal appearances)….shall remain separate.”</p><p>Interestingly, the will states that if Bobbi Kristina were to have died before Whitney, her estate would be split evenly between her ex-husband,&nbsp;&nbsp;Bobby Brown, her mother, brother and sister-in-law (Gary and Pat Houston).</p><p>To date, nine of Houston’s albums appear on the Billboard 200 at number 2, 4, 10, 13, 21, 31, 32, 50, and 80 which has garnered sales up to $700, 000, according to Billboard.com. No word as to how this money will be dispersed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKGur8DAm6Oam5uowaK%2BjZympmdiZX5ze49sZmlwX6y1qsDNnrBmoJ%2BqwLW7zaxksKGcoXqjvs6tn56qXZyus8WMoaauq6Sku268y56YrJ2UYsSqwMdmpq6sk6S6pns%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
