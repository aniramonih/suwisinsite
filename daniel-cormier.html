The day before UFC 232, he relinquished the light heavyweight title with his focus solely on defending the heavyweight title stating: “I’d rather walk away from this way than have the history books say I was stripped”.</p><p>Since the potential matchup with Brock Lesnar, he never materialized, with Lesnar instead opting to re-sign with the WWE, and he decided to fight Miocic again. The rematch took place on August 17, 2019, at UFC 241, just over a year since their first fight. Cormier lost the fight by TKO in the fourth round, ending his reign as heavyweight champion.</p><h2>Daniel Cormier Retirement</h2><p>Daniel Cormier said he might Retire after the UFC 241 Fight vs. Stipe Miocic. “I always said that I was gonna fight [until I was 40],” he said. “I couldn’t make that one, so if I hold true to what I was saying, then this would be the final one.”</p><h2>Daniel Cormier Post heavyweight championship reign</h2><p>On September 23, Cormier on Ariel Helwani’s ESPN MMA Show said his next fight will be his last one and targeting Stipe Miocic for a trilogy fight for the UFC Heavyweight Championship.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-920 data-method=placement-service></span><span class="ezoic-ad ezoic-at-0 narrow-sky-1 narrow-sky-1920 adtester-container
