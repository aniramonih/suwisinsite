In a statement, the multinational food manufacturing company said, ‚Äú‚ÄòBoxes are for cereal, not people‚Äô is the embodiment and celebration of Kellogg Company's commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion, not just within Kellogg Company, but also at the tables of our cereal fans coast to coast. As Kellogg has grown its multiyear allyship with GLAAD, the company hopes to spread the word on allyship and show its support for the transgender and gender nonconforming communities.‚Äù</p><p><strong>READ MORE</strong></p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Coca-Cola, Heinz and Kellogg's: The story behind the iconic food brands that America loves to this day</a></p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Red alert!

Kellogg is not only building on an ongoing commitment to support the LGBTQ+ community, but initiatives that spotlight the importance of using correct pronouns to create safe and welcoming spaces for trans and nonbinary people.‚Äù</p><p>Reportedly, each box of the ‚ÄòTogether With Pride‚Äô contains a ‚ÄòTogether Band‚Äô, which consumers can wear. Giving an idea of what the new boxes include, Doug VanDeVelde, general manager of Kellogg US Cereal Category, mentioned, ‚ÄúOur delicious new recipe features berry-flavored, rainbow hearts dusted with edible glitter. We can't wait for fans to try our latest limited run.‚Äù It has also been said that on the sale of every box, Kellogg‚Äôs will give $3 (up to $140,000) to support GLAAD.</p><p>But Kellogg‚Äôs new initiative has not been appreciated by several people on the internet as a user tweeted, ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt be buying Kellogg‚Äôs or Sally Hanson products anymore, even if they are giving tear out pronouns free that you can wear.‚Äù ‚ÄúI buy the Malt-O-Meal versions of @KelloggCompany cereals.
