As the <a href=#>Express</a> points out, she was born on February 23, 1985, in Vienna, Austria, to a British father and Irish mother. Cox eventually broke into the acting business as a stage actor, before going on to star in several Austrian and German films and TV series prior to "The Last Kingdom."</p><p dir=ltr>Cox's main roles include the TV show "Jerks" and movies such as "The Fatherless" and "Dutschke." However, fans of American television might recognize her from "Homeland," in which she played a character named Claudia in the "Why Is This Night Different?" episode back in 2015. Cox's IMDb page lists 57 credits at the time of this writing, dating all the way back to 2007. She's an on-screen veteran at this point, despite being a relative newcomer in the eyes of many viewers outside of Europe.</p><p dir=ltr>It seems that Cox has a busy upcoming slate as well. According to IMDb, she currently has three projects in development, so fans can look forward to more performances from her in the near future.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbvOqZyrZpOkunCEk2lqbWpfrLWwec%2BlmLKrXZe%2FqrDAZqCnZaSdsm64wKyrZqOZo7Slu8xo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
