Her mother was only 17 years old when she was born.</p><p>She was born and raised in the backyard of their captor’s house in California. Jaycee was purportedly kidnapped at the age of 11 by Phillip and his wife Nancy Garrido.</p><p>She had a traumatizing childhood growing up in such surroundings. Despite the unusual circumstances, her mother did her best to provide a happy life for her children. Despite having only a fifth-grade education, she allegedly began homeschooling her two daughters.</p><p>Jaycee, Starlet’s mother, was not taken to the hospital at the time of her birth. When the Garridos learned about her labor pains, they gave her codeine and forced her to view films of children being delivered so she could learn how to give birth on her own.</p><h2><span id=Dugard_the_actress_Her_Mother_was_regarded_as_her_sister>Dugard, the actress Her Mother was regarded as her sister</span></h2><p>Starlet Dugard and her sister Angel Dugard were born when their mother was extremely young. She and her sister Angel used to regard her mother’s abusers Phillip and Nancy as their parents and their mother as a sister, which was exactly what Garridos taught the kids.</p><h2><span id=Similarly_Hollywoodlife_stated>Similarly, Hollywoodlife stated,</span></h2><p>One of the more challenging components of the girls’ transition process was explaining to them that Jaycee was their mother, not their sister, as the Garridos had trained them to think.</p><p>Besides, despite everything, Starlet’s mother still thought Philip to be her child’s father until a few years ago. Jaycee also stated that she does not want her girls to meet their father in person, but she will accept their decision if they do. Furthermore, she stated,</p><p>“I hope they don’t want to, but as long as he’s in jail and they’re secure, I wouldn’t stand in their way of making that decision,”</p><p>Jaycee Dugard, the mother of Starlet Dugard, became pregnant for the first time when she was 13 years old with her older sister.<br>Jaycee was 13 years old when she became pregnant with her first child, Angel Dugard. She had no idea what she was going through until she realized she was going to have a baby when she was 14 years old. Concerning the subject, she stated,</p><p>“I don’t know how I kept it together or if I was checked out, you know, on another level.” You know, [I was] present, but not for all of it, because it’s terrible on its own. But how did I do it when I was alone?”</p><p>She even stated that she had no idea how she had survived all of that. She did, however, disclose that she was overjoyed to see her daughter’s face.</p><h2><span id=The_Biological_Father_of_Starlet_Dugard_Committed_Numerous_Crimes>The Biological Father of Starlet Dugard Committed Numerous Crimes</span></h2><p>As previously stated, Starlet’s mother, Jaycee Dugard, was kidnapped from a bus stop in Lake Tahoe in 1991 when she was 11 years old. She said that Phillip abused and raped her while she was imprisoned, which resulted in her pregnancy.</p><p>Phillip Garrido, Starlet Dugard’s biological father, and captor, and his wife Nancy Nancy and Phillip Garrido have been charged with rape.</p><p>Phillips Garrido was born in Pittsburg, California on April 5, 1951. According to sources, he was an abductor, serial rapist, pedophile, and hebephile. Furthermore, he was already charged with numerous other crimes before being sentenced to prison in Jaycee’s case.</p><p>He was charged with sexual harassment of a 14-year-old girl, but the case was dropped because the girl refused to testify. Garrido later married his classmate Christine Murphy in 1973.</p><p>He was also sentenced to 15 years in jail for raping her in a leased storage container for 8 hours. However, he kidnapped her when she attempted to leave him due to his aggressive attitude. Furthermore, according to a 1976 court report, Philip was classified as a “sexual deviant and chronic drug abuser.”</p><p>After 18 years in captivity, the starlet’s mother has finally escaped</p><p>The adventure ended when a female cop, Lisa Campell, became suspicious of Garrido and his actions at the University of California, where he had allegedly come with his two children to obtain a permit to distribute religious leaflets.</p><p>Campell, the 40-year-old UC Berkeley special events manager, apparently saw Phillip’s mental instability right away. Not only that, but his daughters, who were born with Jaycee, were pale and exhibited an unusually vacant expression.</p><p>While she urged him to return the next day, on August 25, she did a background check only to discover that Garrido was a sex offender. A day after his return, Garrido stated that he was on parole for rape and kidnapping for the incident that occurred 33 years earlier.</p><p>Despite her strong desire to pursue legal action against him, Campell was unable to do so. Things changed after she called Garrido’s parole officer at the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, who informed her that, contrary to what he had indicated, Garrido did not have a daughter.</p><p>Garrido and his wife Nancy were detained on August 26, 2009, after he admitted to his conduct. Phillip was sentenced to 431 years in prison for kidnapping and 13 charges of sexual abuse.</p><p>Similarly, Nancy was sentenced to 36 years to life in jail for kidnapping, rape by force, and violating California’s “one strike” rape legislation.</p><h2><span id=The_Story_of_Starlet_Dugard_and_Her_Mother_Shook_The_World>The Story of Starlet Dugard and Her Mother Shook The World</span></h2><p>Jaycee Dugard, Starlet’s mother, eventually decided to share her tale with the world two years after her release from captivity. She was finally ready to reveal what she had gone through in her book A Stolen Life in 2011. Everyone was shocked after hearing about her terrifying incident.</p><p>Furthermore, Starlet’s mother stated that she wanted to share her experience with the world because she encouraged other victims to open up and refuse to endure their predicament.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read, Kaylin Wiley, Averie Gilley, and Sophierosejm."}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":4480,"10":2,"11":0,"15":"Arial"}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":0}}}{"1":23}{"1":25,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":0}}}{"1":38}{"1":44,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":0}}}{"1":56}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://superstarsculture.com/kaylin-wiley/"}{"1":23}{"1":25,"2":"https://superstarsculture.com/averie-gilley/"}{"1":38}{"1":44,"2":"https://superstarsculture.com/sophierosejm/"}{"1":56}'>Also Read, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Kaylin Wiley</a>, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Averie Gilley</a>, and <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Sophierosejm</a>.</span></p><h2><span id=Starlet8217s_Family_Story_Inspired_the_Book_8220A_Stolen_Life-A_Memoir8221>Starlet’s Family Story Inspired the Book “A Stolen Life-A Memoir.”</span></h2><p>Jaycee, Starlet’s mother, wrote her first book in 2011, as previously stated.
